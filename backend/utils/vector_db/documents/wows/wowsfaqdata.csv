Mechanics,All about consumables,"Consumables are used in battle to boost the characteristics of your ship or to enable extra features for a certain period of time.

In most cases, the number of consumable ""charges"" is limited, but some types can be activated an unlimited number of times throughout the entire battle; you only need to wait for them to cool down before you can use them again.

General Information
You can view ship consumables in the ""Equipment"" tab. After each battle, any used consumable charges will be automatically resupplied for free.

equip.jpg
Each ship type has their own set of consumables. In certain cases, the list of consumables may change depending on the hull that you install.

After each battle, any used consumable charges are automatically resupplied free of charge.

The consumable cooldown timer countdown begins after the consumable duration ends rather than at the moment of its activation.

The consumable cooldown time can be reduced by 5% with the help of the November Foxtrot signal and by 10% with the help of Consumables Specialist skill.

The number of uses can be increased by one (except for aircraft carrier squadrons) ""charge"" by mastering the Superintendent skill, as well as with the help of a special talent that some unique Commanders have.

The active duration of consumables can be increased by using a range of standard or special upgrades, as well as with the help of Commander skills.

The unique upgrades of some Tier X ships can affect the characteristics of certain consumables.

To learn more about consumables, please follow this link: https://worldofwarships.com/en/content/education/enhancements/"
Mechanics,"How Do You Earn and Spend Credits, Doubloons, and XP?","We're going to tell you how you can earn XP and Credits in battle, and why Credits and Doubloons can be deducted after each battle. By using this information to your advantage, you can earn more XP and Credits at the end of every battle, and you can also make yourself even more useful to your team and increase your chances of winning.

To learn more about how you can earn and spend Credits, Doubloons, and XP, please follow the link: https://worldofwarships.com/en/content/education/in-game_economy/"
Mechanics,How do I earn XP and Credits?,"Active participation in the battle increases your earnings. This includes:

Capturing and defending Key Areas.
Total damage to ships and destroyed ships.
Total damage to aircraft and destroyed aircraft.
Potential damage.
Detection of enemy ships, aircraft, and torpedoes.
Damage upon your spotting.
General contribution to the battle.
Capturing and defending Key Areas
The more points you earn when capturing a Key Area, the greater the reward you will receive.

The reward is guaranteed if you defend your Key Area. The more points you block while the enemy is capturing the Key Area, the more XP and Credits you will receive at the end of the battle.

Credits and XP for defending a Key Area are awarded in any case, regardless of the outcome of the battle and the way you won or lost (destroying all enemy ships or capturing the Key Area).

Total damage to ships and destroyed ships
Total damage to ships and the number of destroyed ships are tracked statistics that contribute to your earnings.

The rewards for damage are determined by the percentage of the target ship's hit points removed, not the amount of raw damage dealt. Removing 20% of a destroyer's HP will generate the same base earnings as removing 20% of a same-tier battleship's HP.

This rule is implemented because different ship types and ships in the game have different HP pool sizes. The more damage you deal to enemy ships, the more XP and Credits you get at the end of the battle.

No XP or Credits are awarded for damage dealt to ship modules or for critical module damage.

Tier VIII and X aircraft carriers differ from other ship types: Tier VIII and X carriers earn more XP for dealing damage (about 5% more for Tier VIII and 15% for Tier X) and less for winning battles. This means that carrier players who perform well but lose a battle are less likely to appear at the bottom of their team score list.

Total damage to aircraft and destroyed aircraft
The economic reward for destroying aircraft is distributed in the same way as the reward for damage to ships and destroyed ships. Credits and XP are awarded not only for destroyed aircraft but also for damage dealt to aircraft. The aircraft type (attack aircraft, torpedo bomber, or bomber) does not matter. However, if you destroy an enemy aircraft while playing an aircraft carrier, you earn more XP and Credits.

Potential damage
Potential damage is the sum of the maximum damage of all shells, bombs, torpedoes, etc. that hit a ship or pass within 700 m of it.

The higher your ship tier, the higher the base earnings you receive for the battle. However, the cost of servicing your ship (ammunition resupply and damage repair) also increases.

When the battle is over, all of your actions in the battle determine the sums of XP and Credits you earn. 

If your team wins, you will receive more XP than if you lose."
Mechanics,Why are Credits (Doubloons) deducted after a battle?,"Credits are deducted after each battle to service your ship. (https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Ship:The_Economics_of_Battle?_gl=1*17k96yr*_gcl_au*MTMzMDk1NDE4OS4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*FPAU*MTMzMDk1NDE4OS4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*_ga*MTIzMTg5NDA3Ny4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*_ga_BWRKLL4HR5*MTcxNDUwMjg0Ny4xNC4xLjE3MTQ1MTQyNDQuNTguMC4zMjc0MTE5MDI.*_fplc*cWphQXRsWVVPaFBialE2QU1CTlZHQzlpdG0lMkJwSXhSRWRmN2l4VWhKRVJBbGZuZWNtR2dBTzFrVzUlMkZHNE5XalFYZEFDNXZTdWc2TlJ0WDd5ZVVwbXdtQ1Bja05UaURBZ2JyakxncDQlMkZGUXhDdUhaU0xjWG5OVWZwNFU4Q1h3JTNEJTNE&_ga=2.38094563.1366991284.1714502847-1231894077.1707424508) If you do not earn enough Credits to cover this in a battle, they are deducted from your account balance. Operating costs include:

Ammunition resupply
Credits are deducted for spent:

Main battery shells
Torpedoes
Aircraft ammunition
Depth Charge Airstrike and Depth Charges armament uses
Service cost
The service cost is a flat fee that depends on the tier, type, and Premium status of the ship.

Camouflage
If a camouflage is mounted and the automatic resupply option is on, its cost will be deducted from the account.

Additional information
Different types of battles have different profitability. For instance, players will earn fewer Credits in Co-op Battles than in Random Battles. As for Operations, the sum of earned Credits depends on the number of earned Stars, as well as on the individual results of each player. More Credits can be earned when you deal damage to higher-tier ships."
Mechanics,How Does the Matchmaker Select Teams?,"The matchmaker forms teams in two stages:

A combat group is formed taking into account the applicable limits (see below) and battle-tier settings for each ship.
From the ships selected for the combat group, a team is formed based on the principle of the maximum equality of the sums of the ships' balance weights.
The balance weight is a characteristic of a ship that takes into account the ship power as part of a team and does not reflect the actual power balance between two specific ships.

When matching teams, the matchmaker tends to evenly distribute ships in terms of nations."
Mechanics,How Does the Matchmaker Determine the Battle Tier for a Ship?,"The maximum battle tier that all Tier I–IV ships can get put into is calculated according to the following formula: Ship tier + 1.
The maximum battle tier that all other ships can get put into is calculated according to the following formula: Ship tier + 2.
There can be up to three aircraft carriers in each team in battle.
The battle tier is equal to the tier of the highest-tier ship in a combat group."
Mechanics,Limits for Matching Teams,"The following limits are set for matching teams:

The maximum number of players in battle is 24.
The maximum number of aircraft carriers in battle is 2–6.
The number of top-tier ships and battleships of tiers lower than the battle tier in both teams should be the same.
Aircraft carriers in both teams should be of the same tier.
The numbers of destroyers and battleships can differ by 1.
The number of cruisers can differ by 2."
Mechanics,Player Queue,"In Random Battles, when players click the ""Battle!"" button, they enter the list of players not yet assigned to a battle, which is continuously processed by the matchmaker. When the list of unassigned players is processed, players' waiting times are taken into account—those who have waited longer get processed first.

If there are no suitable battles for the player in terms of their tier or ship type (for example, the player has selected an aircraft carrier and the limit for this ship type has already been reached in all battles suitable for their tier), a new battle gets created for this player."
Mechanics,Waiting Time,"If waiting time is too long, a battle can start with an incomplete lineup (10х10, 11х11, etc.), but the limits in terms of ship types and numbers are maintained (see above)."
Mechanics,Superships,"Access to Superships
Superships are positioned just after Tier X ships in the Tech Tree. These special ships have mechanics that are entirely new for our game, which makes for a noticeable qualitative jump from Tier X ships. To purchase a specific supership, you must also research the Tier X ship of the corresponding branch. It's not necessary to research superships.

The cost of purchasing superships depends on their type:

Super battleships: 57 million Credits.
Super carriers: 48 million Credits.
Super cruisers: 47.5 million Credits.
Super destroyers: 45 million Credits.
Supership Economics
Superships yield Credits at the level of Tier X ships.
The cost of servicing superships is 360,000 Credits.
Permanent camouflages for superships are purchased separately from the ships, just like for other researchable ships from the Tech Tree.
Permanent camouflages for superships do not reduce their service cost or increase their Credit earnings."
Mechanics,Alternative Fire Mode: Burst Fire,"Each turret has one additional firing mode that is activated by pressing the F key. After switching to this mode, each separate turret can automatically deliver several consecutive salvos in rapid succession. After firing, the guns take a long time to reload.

Depending on the ship, activating this mode can change the characteristics of guns and shells.

You can switch back to the standard firing mode by pressing the F key. However, to fire again, you'll need to wait until all turrets have ceased firing in the alternative fire mode. A long reload period will follow a switch in firing mode, after which the turrets will be able to fire in either standard or alternative fire mode again."
Mechanics,Alternative Torpedoes,"Two types of torpedoes that can be switched between in battle. The torpedoes differ by various parameters such as range, speed, and damage.

Switching to alternative torpedoes takes an additional fixed amount of time that's separate from the reloading mechanic. Torpedo launcher reloading is suspended while switching between torpedo types and then resumes immediately after. "
Mechanics,Combat Instructions,"Combat Instructions grant a temporary boost to the ships' characteristics in battle. To activate the bonus, you need to fill a special meter by carrying out ""adjustment fire"" at any locked target—each turret salvo that hits a target or splashes near it is taken into account. Once the meter is filled, the bonus is activated by pressing the F key, which allows you to use the boost at the most optimal moment of your choosing.

Depending on the ship, activating this mode can change the characteristics of guns and shells.

If your ship ceases firing for some time, the progress of the adjustment fire meter gradually resets. However, progress won't decrease while the bonus is active or if the adjustment fire meter is already full. "
Mechanics,Tactical Squadrons,"The ships carry two types of squadrons: standard and tactical. While standard squadrons are a carrier's striking power that players are already familiar with, tactical squadrons constitute a new weapon.

Tactical squadrons on board the new supercarriers are composed of very fast jet-propelled aircraft. This feature allows them to quickly cover substantial distances and carry out lightning-fast attacks against enemy ships.

The specific characteristics of tactical squadrons depend on the ship."
Mechanics,Vehicles: ship upgrades,"Each ship can be upgraded with additional equipment. These upgrades are sets of special engineering solutions that improve various characteristics of ships.

Upgrades improve the combat characteristics of various ship systems.

There are different types of upgrades that improve the characteristics and HP of combat modules—for example, upgrades for main armaments, secondary battery guns, or air groups. Upgrades coupled with properly chosen Commander skills can significantly improve certain ship characteristics.

Players who have reached Service Record Level 11 can install upgrades.

Upgrade types:
The following types of upgrades exist:

Standard. Available to all players for Credits in the corresponding tab in the Port.
Special. Can be purchased in the Armory for Coal.
Unique. Can be obtained in the Research Bureau category of the Armory for Research Points. Unique upgrades can only be used on certain Tier X ships. If you sell a unique upgrade, you can restore it later by following this guide (https://na.wargaming.net/support/en/products/wows/article/22943/).
"
Mechanics,What Are Ranked Battles and How to Play Them?,"Ranked Battles are a special competitive battle type where players fight against each other in two-team battles, advance through ranks in leagues, and earn valuable rewards. The battle type is available from Access Level 16.

Ranked Battles are divided into seasons. Ranked Battles seasons are held on a regular basis with short breaks between each one. This means that you can choose between Random, Co-op, and Ranked Battles, as the latter battle type is almost regularly available.

To switch to the Ranked Battles mode, click the ""Select battle type"" inscription to the right of the ""Battle!"" button in the Port.

Mechanics,How to Participate in Ranked Battles,"The structure and rules of Ranked Battles may differ depending on the season. More information about the Ranked Battles season rules can be found in a Wiki article (https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Ship:Ranked_Battles?_gl=1*1vqu3h2*_gcl_au*MTMzMDk1NDE4OS4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*FPAU*MTMzMDk1NDE4OS4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*_ga*MTIzMTg5NDA3Ny4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*_ga_BWRKLL4HR5*MTcxNDY1OTQ2Ni4xNS4xLjE3MTQ2NTk2MzUuMC4wLjE1Mjc4MjE1MTc.*_fplc*YUR3bE1DRlJJTDFQUSUyQk9aRDhKaEg2S2ZTS0RmNVZsZmQlMkJTdEp0Q0tnZ2NISXQ4SW9BSGpUS1hSS0RzMWJLZyUyRmNsU0NEeUt0eWh2a2NHeEdpb3A4QjZ3aHY4S0NHWVRHRFpTcTk1Y1JJdnBQZ3Fxc3BBMkVIZWxPcSUyRkRlM3clM0QlM0Q.&_ga=2.161747966.317960896.1714659473-1231894077.1707424508).

There are also common rules for all Ranked Battles seasons:

Divisions aren't allowed in Ranked Battles.
Season achievements aren't inherited from previous Ranked seasons and won’t transfer to those that follow."
Mechanics,Ranked Seasons and Sprints,"Ranked Battles are held in the format of seasons with short breaks between them.

Each season is divided into several Sprints.

The Sprint is the main time frame in a Ranked Battles season, and its duration is determined by the rules of the current season (usually a week or two).

Within each Sprint, a player can reach Rank 1 in their current league and qualify for the next league. If a player qualifies, they will start the next Sprint from the lowest rank of the next league. If a player fails to qualify, their progress will be reset and they will start the next Sprint at the lowest rank of their current league.

There are no qualifications in the highest league. This means that progress resets with the start of each new Sprint, even if Rank 1 was achieved."
Mechanics,Ranked Stars and Ranks,"Progress in Ranked Battles involves moving from one league to another. To do so, you need to earn Ranked Stars. These Stars earned allow you to attain new ranks and qualify for the next league.

A Star is awarded for a victory and deducted for a loss or a draw; however, a Star can be kept in a lost battle if you take first place in your team in terms of the battle results (relevant for some leagues only).

Ranks are divided into revocable and irrevocable types. When losing a Star, a revocable rank will be lost. You cannot lose an irrevocable rank. Irrevocable ranks are visually highlighted with a special color fill inside the emblem."
Mechanics,Ranked Qualification,"Qualification is a special rank that unlocks after reaching Rank 1 in the current league (except for the highest league). Qualification battles involve those who are trying to qualify for the higher league and players of that higher league.

These battles are fought according to the rules of the higher league. "
Mechanics,Ranked Rewards,"You can earn various rewards for participating in Ranked Battles: Coal, Steel, expendable camouflages, Doubloons, commemorative flags, Ranked Tokens, etc. Rewards are given for:

A certain number of victories in a league
Reaching Rank 1 in a league
Qualifying for the next league
Rewards are refreshed every Sprint and can be earned repeatedly.

The final reward for participating in a Ranked Battles season is a Ranked Token. Ranked Tokens can be exchanged in the Armory for stylish permanent camouflages."
Missions & Events,Birthday Gifts: FAQ,"30 of September 2021 we launched the Player Birthday campaign and here are the answers to some frequently asked questions.

""I didn't get any gifts!""
Please check if all conditions are met:

your date of birth is specified on the Account Management page
your account is linked to your email address and confirmed
you gave us permission to send you letters
you played at least 1 WoWS battle in the last 365 days
Also please note that you can only get gifts after getting a B-day email, so if you haven't received the email, you won't get a gift.
All conditions are met, but I still don't get the B-day email!
Our email service processes data once a day. If you set the date of birth in your profile today, you will get the email no earlier than the next day.

I got my social network profile linked to my WG account and my date of birth on the Account Management page is set from the social network profile, can I get presents?
Yes, if you link and confirm your email and agree to receive emails from us. On your Birthday you will receive the email and will get your gifts in the game.

Please note that no player can get more than 1 gift in 365 days."
Missions & Events,"I was extremely close to completing a mission when the time limit was reached, can I get the reward anyway?","We know that situations like this can feel tough, especially after you have dedicated time to the game and when you want to get as much as possible from our special offers and contests.

Unfortunately, Player Support is unable to assist with this specific topic, as the time limits of all missions are set in stone.

Making any exceptions in such situations would be unfair to those players who were able to achieve all the necessary goals in time and won the reward in this way.

Do note that when you are close to the end of the time limit for a particular combat mission, it is the finish time of the battle, not the start time, that determines whether the results can be counted toward completing that mission."

Clans,Naval Battles: Quick Guide,"Under the Naval Battle section of the Clan tab, your Clan's Commander or Deputy Commander can opt in your Clan for the week. They can check the box beneath the button to automatically opt into future weeks.

The Naval Battle is held every week and consists of two stages. The Preparation stage runs from Monday through Thursday. The Engagement stage spans Friday through Sunday. To earn the right to compete against your opponents, your Clan has to complete a special mission during the Preparation stage.

Clans from all servers that complete the combat mission during the Preparation stage compete against other Clans from Friday through Sunday.

Clan vs. Clan is the standard format for the Engagement stage. A group format was added in Update 0.10.10. Starting from Update 0.10.11, the standard format of the Engagement stage is replaced by the group format every 4 weeks. Clans are randomly divided between several groups of 25 or 50 Clans each, and they compete against each other within the group according to the same rules that apply in a Clan vs. Clan format.

The Clan objective in a group format is to earn as many Stars as possible for completing missions from a table and take a higher place in the group.

A table will display the types and nations of ships that can be helmed into battle:
 
NOTE: During the Engagement stage, you need to have  ""Count Attempts"" enabled in the Naval Battle section for your progress to count toward your Clan's missions! Fight wisely—you only have a limited number of attempts to complete the mission.

Naval Battles may grant bonus Stars for clearing bars for randomly selected ship types/nations. More info about bonus Stars is available in the Naval Battle tab.

Oil is the main reward for the Naval Battle competition. It's earned by all participating Clans, depending on their level of activity."

Network settings,DNS server address is not found,"If you're unable to update or install World of Tanks, you may be encountering a DNS issue from your Internet service provider (ISP). This article will help you to address these issues.  

For World of Tanks: dl-wot-gc.wargaming.net
Flush your DNS Cache
Try changing your DNS server to Google Public DNS
Before you change your DNS settings to use Google Public DNS, be sure to write down the current server addresses or settings. It is very important that you keep these numbers for backup purposes, in case you need to revert to them at any time.

Google Public DNS IP addresses:
The Google Public DNS IP addresses (IPv4) are as follows:

8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4
The Google Public DNS IPv6 addresses are as follows:

2001:4860:4860::8888
2001:4860:4860::8844
You can use either address as your primary or secondary DNS server. You can specify both addresses, but do not specify the same address as both primary and secondary.

You can configure Google Public DNS addresses for either IPv4 or IPv6 connections, or both. For IPv6-only networks with a NAT64 gateway using the 64:ff9b::/96 prefix, you can use Google Public DNS64 instead of Google Public DNS IPv6 addresses, providing connectivity to IPv4-only services without any other configuration.

Some devices use separate fields for all eight parts of IPv6 addresses and cannot accept the :: IPv6 abbreviation syntax. For such fields enter:

2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888
2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8844
Windows:
The instructions may differ between different versions/releases of each operating system, we will only give one version as an example. If you need specific instructions for your operating system/version, please consult your vendor's documentation
Example: Windows 7

Go to the Control Panel
Click Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center -> Change Adapter Settings
Select the connection for which you want to configure Google Public DNS. For example:
To change the settings for an Ethernet connection, right-click Local Area Connection -> Properties
To change the settings for a wireless connection, right-click Wireless Network Connection -> Properties
Select the Networking tab. Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and then click Properties
Click Advanced and select the DNS tab. If there are any DNS server IP addresses listed there, write them down for future reference, and remove them from this window
Click OK
Select ""Use the following DNS server addresses"". If there are any IP addresses listed in the Preferred DNS server or Alternate DNS server, write them down for future reference
Replace those addresses with the IP addresses of the Google DNS servers:
For IPv4: 8.8.8.8 and/or 8.8.4.4.
For IPv6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and/or 2001:4860:4860::8844.
For IPv6-only: you can use Google Public DNS64 instead of the IPv6 addresses in the previous point

Diagnostics and computer settings,Discontinuation of macOS Support,"Captains!

World of Warships is constantly evolving, with new ships and maps appearing in the game on a regular basis. We also add a lot of other content, such as new technologies intended to boost performance and enhance the quality of the audio and graphics.

In order to maintain that level of productivity, we unfortunately have to cease support for macOS.

The popularity of this operating system (OS) is quite low among our players. Aside from that, this OS has a number of specific features that take a lot of time and effort to manage on the part of our Dev Team. This has a negative impact on game development and hampers our ability to add new content and improvements. Bearing all these factors in mind, we've decided to cease support for macOS.

We're informing you in advance of these planned changes. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding. We would also like to share a couple of possible options that might allow macOS players to continue enjoying World of Warships:

World of Warships is available via GeForce NOW. For more info, go to https://www.nvidia.com/geforce-now/
Players with macOS can try using Boot Camp to launch the Windows operating system on their device and play World of Warships. For more info, navigate to https://support.apple.com/HT201468. Please note: Boot Camp is not officially supported by Wargaming, and we do not guarantee that World of Warships will run correctly when using it."
Diagnostics and computer settings,MacOS wrapper client crashes,"The World of Warships wrapper should identify your graphics card make & model on launch and inform the game of how much video memory is available. This prevents the game from trying to load, or not cleanup often enough, too many graphical assets. However if the wrapper doesn't detect the graphic card's available memory correctly this can lead to World of Warships freezing up after a number of battles or lengthy play.

You can manually set the amount of available video memory by launching World of Warships and just as it first launches under the File menu choose Run Command. In the Run Command window enter regedit and run.

Once the Registry Editor comes up, browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Wine/Direct3D and in Direct3D right-click and add a new string value called VideoMemorySize and set it to 512.

If the Direct3D folder doesn't exist, right-click on the Wine folder, New Key, and rename it Direct3D

Now try to run the game again."

Sometimes voice chat freezes after a network connection has dropped / been re-established (e.g. when switching between wireless networks). To fix the problem, exit the game, confirm a functioning network connection, and then restart."
Diagnostics and computer settings,Why is my audio quality poor?,"Poor audio quality can be caused by a low Internet connection speed or a slow processor (CPU). Run the Task Manager to check how busy your computer's resources are (for example, the processor load should be significantly lower than 100%)."
Diagnostics and computer settings,"I can't hear anything at all, or no one can hear me. What should I do?","Make sure you press the voice chat button (usually ""O"").
Check the input/output serviceability.
Make sure that your microphone and headset are plugged into the appropriate inputs.
Make sure that the sound is not muted or minimized. If this doesn't help, check the system sound settings and make sure that the sound is not muted or minimized.
Consider disabling your firewall. If this helps, open the following ports in the firewall:
* Incoming UDP: 5060, 5062, 3478.
* Outgoing TCP: 80 and 443.
* Universal UDP: 12000–17000."

Diagnostics and computer settings,My voice chat keeps dropping. What can I do?,"Interruptions in voice chat can be caused by software faults in your router. Try rebooting the router.

Voice chat can function incorrectly in networks that include some types of NAT transversal or firewall components.

Note that running Xfire while playing disables voice keyboard bindings. A workaround for this is to use the middle mouse button as your talk key."
Diagnostics and computer settings,Voice chat is having trouble connecting. What should I do?,"Make sure that your router is updated and running the very latest software.

Test your voice connection with the default settings (SIP ALG enabled, SPI Firewall enabled, and special forwarding rules disabled).

If voice chat doesn't work reliably, try disabling SIP ALG first (if possible).

If voice chat still doesn't work reliably, try disabling the SPI Firewall as well (if possible).

General Questions,Overwolf Plugin,"Attention Captains!

It has come to our attention that using Overwolf (which may come bundled with other applications, such as TeamSpeak) with World of Warships causes the following issues:

During its installation, Overwolf modifies World of Warships game client without asking for a confirmation and puts a mod into the World of Warships install directory. Example: D:\Games\World_of_Warships_RU\res_mods\0.7.10.1\PNFMods\owplugin folder.
This mod actively logs your game data while you play by reading python.log, damage dealt/taken, ribbons, frags, and list of battle participants. This information seems to be recorded to owevent.log file.
While recording information the mod appears to decrease game performance. While we did not have time to test all configurations yet (as we wanted to share the information ASAP), we saw a decrease from 75 to 48-56 FPS on our i7-8700K / GTX1080Ti test machine.
We want to make you aware of the following information:
If the owplugin folder with the mod is deleted from World of Warships game files, Overwolf re-installs this when launched;
If Overwolf is uninstalled normally, the mod remains installed.
With that in mind, we would like to recommend the following:

If you have Overwolf, you can check the difference in game performance yourself. To do this, launch the game from Wargaming.net Game Center or Legacy Launcher in safe mode. Safe mode disables res_mods modifications which include the one installed by Overwolf.
If you want to stop using Overwolf, you will need to uninstall it AND manually delete the World of Warships mod. To do this:
Find and delete the owplugin folder according to the games installation path on your machine.
If you’re not sure or not experienced enough just clear the whole res_mods folder, you will need to reinstall any mods you’ve been using.
Always read EULA of all products you use. We cannot take responsibility for what and how 3rd party applications do.
If we get any new information on this matter, we will let you know ASAP.

Thank you for your attention!"

World of Warships (http://worldofwarships.com/?_gl=1*1vzhhvb*_gcl_au*MjEwMzk3MzIwMi4xNzE2MDgwNDUz*_ga*MTUxMjExMDkzLjE3MDgwNTk5ODY.*_ga_BWRKLL4HR5*MTcxODA5MjI3MC44LjEuMTcxODA5MzI3MS4wLjAuMjEwNjE0MTUxMg..) is a Massive Multiplayer Online Experience that puts you at the helm of warships ranging from nimble destroyers to multi-ton juggernauts, and in the heart of fast-paced sea battles of the first half on the 20th Century!

Learn the strategies and tactic subtleties of war at sea to achieve victory!

From angling your vessel for the perfect broadside to launching a fast flanking attack with torpedoes, or engaging a battered enemy in an intense one on one duel – Nothing happens the same way twice, and each tactic has its own rewards.

Look forward to a large array of warships and game styles to choose from; struggling for air supremacy with Carriers ,  holding the line with Battleships and Heavy Cruisers, and screaming down the enemy battle-line with Light cruisers and Fast Destroyers.

A Vast Fleet of Warships

Each class and individual ship has its own unique set of strengths and weaknesses.

The combinations of speed, armor, firepower, and range combine to create ships with distinct personalities.

The nimble Destroyer will be able to outrun any opponent, and get in key shots, while Cruisers can function in both the scout or defensive role, and one burst from a Battleship will severely damage, if not sink a warship.

Aircraft Carriers can launch squadrons of fighters, torpedo carriers, or bombers, depending on whether they want to protect their own fleet or strike at the enemy as they assume a main role of support ship to their Battle-Group. 

Remember, only working together as a team will help you achieve victory!

A Wide Variety of Battle Locations

It is our goal to test your skills in a widely-varying set of environments, from foggy Atlantic waters to sun-drenched and deadly Pacific Ocean archipelagos.

All of these locations will offer changing weather conditions that will challenge your sailing and tactical skills to the limit.

Yurra,The WoWs mindset and the approach to getting good,"
The most important thing to remember in WoWs is to set your expectations to the bare minimum. While it is formally a team-based game, you have to keep in mind at all times that your team can not be relied upon. Your team is your meatshield, you should not rely on them to do even the most basic of tasks, and they exist almost solely to buy you enough time to make the most out of your own ship’s strengths and use them to carry yourself and up to 11 other dead weights to victory. 
This may sound extremely cynical, but this is what the design of the game encourages. There is very little mandatory ship synergy in the game and almost every ship is designed to operate as an individual unit.

Don’t blame your team unless you have played your ship to the peak of its abilities. Focus on thinking about what you could have done better in the given situation rather than wasting your energy and malding over your teammates.

The next thing to remember is to know what your ship’s strengths and win conditions are, and also what your weaknesses are. You have to learn them by playing the game, using guides like this and observing how other proficient players play their ships. Don’t try pulling off bullshit like early game torpedo rushes or getting into range of your secondary guns in the early game just because you saw somebody else pull it off once in a thousand games. Stick to what your ship can consistently do well and avoid doing what you can’t do. 

You will have to learn the enemy’s weaknesses. There is a very large number of ships in the game, but you can ballpark rules on how to approach engagements with certain ship archetypes (like brawler BBs, fire support BBs, ranged DPS cruisers, radar cruisers, short range high DPM cruisers, torpedoboat DDs, gunboat DDs etc.). You also need to know things like approximate damage output, the drop of damage output with range, ammo type strengths, general feel of a ship’s survivability, additional enemy strengths like torpedoes or radars, additional specific weaknesses like overmatchable plating etc. Such a list would be very comprehensive and at this moment I really can’t be arsed coming up with one.

At first, play passively around punishing the enemy’s mistakes, and only think about making flashy plays later in the game when the enemy numbers thin out. Balancing survival with dealing meaningful damage is exceptionally important to master.

Defending is much easier than attacking due to how the game’s mechanics are designed. By pushing you make your ship easier to hit, you can’t control your engagement distance as effectively as when kiting, you can get into effective range of enemy torpedoes or generally walk into ambushes. Because of this, you should favour being on the defending flank rather than the attacking one. There is nothing cowardly about running away to keep an optimal distance from the enemy in order to win a fight.

If you are clearly winning, think about how the enemy can jeopardise your victory and take precautions to prevent it from happening,while maximising your own personal score.

If you are losing, think about how you can make plays that utilise your ship’s strengths that can swing the game back into your team’s favour. You also need to be able to recognise that a game is irrecoverably lost at a certain point, at which point you should look to maximise your personal score in order to maximise the earnings for the game.
"
Yurra,Ship type rundown,"Battleships (BBs) are large ships with large HP pools, large calibre guns, powerful AP shells, long range, mostly good armour, but are relatively inaccurate (more or less), have bad concealment and are usually slower and less manoeuvrable than most other ship types
their role in battle is tanking and/or fire support
they can be divided into several archetypes
the first division is by average engagement range 
brawlers/close range (Germans (KM), Soviets (VMF))
mid range BBs (USN, Brits (RN), French, Italians)
long range BBs (Japanese (IJN), some premiums like Slava, Thunderer, Incomparable, Constellation, Borodino)
the second division is by role in battle
tank BBs (most BBs’ role in battle is tanking to some extent)
close range specialists (KM BCs) 
fire support BBs (USN hybrid BBs, FR BBs, some premiums like Slava, Thunderer, Incomparable, Constellation, Borodino)
these roles are not strict and more or less overlap in different ratios

Cruisers (CA/CLs) are the most diverse class
by gun calibre, they're divided into ultralight (up to 130 mm guns; also known as anti-aircraft cruisers), light (140-180 mm), heavy (190-254 mm) and battlecruisers/large cruisers (283 mm and larger)
ultralight and light cruisers are usually more agile and stealthy than other cruisers, have higher damage output but also weaker armour and shorter effective range
heavy cruisers, and especially battlecruisers, have guns that are more optimised for medium and long range combat, better armour and larger HP pools but worse manoeuvrability
by archetype, they're divided on DPS, utility and tank cruisers
DPS cruisers' main role is impacting games through damage (IJN CAs and CLs, KM CAs, FR CA/Ls, RN CAs, RN CLs when equipped with smoke, IT CAs, NL CAs, Pan Asian CLs, Salem, most cruisers below T8)
utility cruisers impact games by controlling cap zones with their radar (USN CAs and CLs, VMF CLs, Tallinn, RN CLs equipped with radar)
tank cruisers usually sacrifice damage output, and sometimes utility, for high survivability (VMF CAs, Pan American CLs, Napoli)
these roles can also overlap to varying degrees; for example, Moskva can be considered a tank/utility cruiser

Destroyers (DDs) are also very diverse
the main division is on universal-type and DPS-type DDs - this depends on whether their concealment is good enough to contest capture zones comfortably (DPS types usually make up for this with good damage output)
universal-type branches and ships are: USN DDs, IJN DDs (Shimakaze branch, and the Harugumo branch below T8), KM DDs (Z branch and pre-split), RN DDs, Ognevoi, Grozovoi, Neustrashimy, EU DDs (Halland branch), Tromp, Pan Asian DDs, Vampire
DPS type branches and ships are: Forrest Sherman, FR DDs, KM DDs (Elbing branch), VMF DDs (except the above mentioned ones), IJN (Akizuki and above), IT DDs, EU DDs (Gdansk branch), Friesland/Groningen, Ragnar
universal types are further divided into gunboats, torpedoboats and true hybrids, depending on their main damage source
the main role of universal-types is contesting cap zones in the early game, keeping enemy DDs in check, spotting enemy ships, and supporting with damage, smokes or other forms of utility
DPS types' main role is doing damage, flanking and disrupting the enemy team, whereas contesting cap zones is secondary and is usually done in the mid to late game

Aircraft carriers (CVs) are a class that is designed around applying damage anywhere on the map with relatively low risk, and the interaction between them and other ships is quite superficial, which is why they're almost universally hated
their main role is doing damage and killing ships, with spotting as a secondary role with strike aircraft or fighters (even though they can deploy fighter patrols, they are mostly useless for defending allies)

Submarines (subs) are mostly assassins, sneaking up to enemy ships and pumping their face full of torpedoes or trying to hit the enemy with homing torpedoes from a distance while remaining undetected; much like with CVs, counterplay options against subs are quite limited and the tactics they employ are extremely annoying for most players to interact with "

USN CAs 
exceptional AP performance (much steeper armour angle needed to ricochet them (60-67.5°)), above average to excellent HE and AP DPM
mediocre ballistics performance and relatively low range
overall very good main batteries that may be a bit hard to use
quite good AA
decent durability (Baltimore and above are resistant to 380mm AP overmatch, Pensacola and NO are resistant to 356 mm overmatch)
decent dynamics (Des Moines with the legendary upgrade mounted has extremely good acceleration and agility), relatively low top speed
standard cruiser consumables, with access to radar starting at T8 (10km range)
role in battle: fire support, island hopping, radar support
T11 special feature: burst fire with 3 shots in a salvo
the strongest cruiser branch in the game
 
USN CLs 
exceptionally high DPM with both shell types, poor AP performance past close range
bad ballistics (can shoot comfortably over islands), average to below average range
overall, very good main batteries for close range combat
very good AA (will inflict high long-term plane losses)
subpar durability due to weak armour plating
good agility but low top speed
great concealment
can mount both hydroacoustics and Defensive AA simultaneously, T8+ get access to radar (9km) 
role in battle: close range DPS, fire support, island hoppers, radar support
overall a strong branch
 
KM CAs 
very high AP damage despite relatively low penetration, weak HE shell alpha damage, but with improved penetration (1/4 of calibre) and high rate of fire
good ballistics and range
overall, very strong main batteries (except for Hipper)

average dynamics
average concealment
standard cruiser consumables with improved Hydro (increased range and duration)
role in battle: medium range kiting and DPS
overall quite a solid branch (except for the Hipper, fuck Hipper), highly recommended as a starter branch
 
RN CLs 
only get access to AP shells with improved ricochet angles (60-75°) and very short fuse time (virtually can't overpenetrate, which increases their damage output vs broadsides and DDs massively)
arcing ballistics, low range
overall good main batteries
AA is not worth mentioning until T9, when it becomes quite good
good torpedoes for kiting
very weak armour and vulnerable citadels that make them quite unforgiving

excellent concealment 
have access to smoke and heal from T5 onwards (T8+ get a supercharged heal which can heal up to 48% of their HP in one go), can only mount hydro (no DFAA), T8, 9 and 10 can slot radar (10km) in place of smoke
T11 special feature: burst fire mode that improves AP shell penetration and damage
role in battle depends on the consumable choice
with smoke, they are flanking DPS cruisers that can deny pushes
with radar (only recommend for Edinburgh and Minotaur) they are DD hunters and opportunists
very hard to play, yet very strong branch
 
RN CAs

subpar dynamics with average top speed and large turning circles
average concealment
standard cruiser consumables and radar (12 km range, short duration)
role in battle: tanking, radar support, broadside punishment, pushing
overall, quite an underwhelming branch for random battles, whose characteristics paradoxically make them excel in competitive modes and ranked battles

average to below average survivability until T8, when they get improved armour plating and fast cooldown Repairs; T8+ are additionally handicapped by 60 second fire duration despite not having battlecruiser guns and/or large HP pools 
have access to DFAA and hydro simultaneously, T8+ get access to fast cooldown heals
role in battle: fire support, stalemate breakers

Pan-Asian (PA) CLs 
underwhelming guns with poor ballistics, very weak AP, average HE DPM and low range
very strong torpedoes (special ""deep-water"" torpedoes with decent damage and very low detectability which makes them exceptionally hard to dodge for ships without hydro, but they also can’t hit DDs)

starting at T6, they get access to Combat Instructions - a special ability that drastically improves consumable cooldown after being charged up by landing hits in rapid succession
role in battle: medium range tanking and aggressive play, playing around getting the Combat Instructions activated
except for the top tiers, a rather poorly performing branch

Yurra,Starter branches,"Good starter branches are USN CVs, USN BBs (Montana branch), IJN BBs, IJN cruisers, German cruisers, Soviet cruisers (Nevsky branch), IJN DDs  (Shimakaze branch), USN DDs, German DDs (Z-52 branch) and German subs. These branches are not too easy nor too hard to play, and they will teach you the basics of gameplay for each class. Pick one from each class and see what you like.

USN DDs have a good blend of characteristics and show you all 3 universal-type DD archetypes, starting off with gunboats, Benson being a true hybrid and transitioning to torpedoboats at the end of the branch. They also don’t have any outrageous gimmicks, and most of the skill set you learn with them will apply to other DDs.

IJN torpedoboats teach you gun trigger discipline, torpedo marksmanship and how to leverage your concealment, while having a safety net in the form of smoke and not having any unusual gimmicks.

German DDs teach you to respect other DDs' strengths, how to leverage your own strengths, and consumable management, while having a good balance between guns and torps. 

IJN cruisers because they have good guns with decent armour at lower tiers without special gimmicks like many other cruisers. 

German cruisers are recommended for similar reasons, they are very consistent damage dealers that aren't too easy to kill (with the exception of Königsberg and Nürnberg). 

VMF CLs offer good damage output with comfortable ballistics, and teach you how to watch your broadside exposure and how to use radar at high tiers. 

USN and IJN BBs offer well balanced characteristics with good guns and decent armor (with IJN BBs trading some armour for better guns), without special gimmicks that can spoil you or throw your impressions off. 

USN CVs are quite easy to play but are, at the same time, quite effective, and teach you the basics of how to operate squadrons that you will find on most CVs.

German subs are relatively forgiving to play but are very effective, and will teach you fundamentals of submarine gameplay.
"
Yurra,How to grind?,"Many new players struggle with getting enough credits to progress down the tech tree or want to speed their grind up in some way, and this guide will give you some tips on how to make it easier.

Don’t play co-op. Co-op gives you about 50% less XP and credits compared to other game modes.
If you are playing Operations, you should aim to do them with all secondary objectives completed because they will increase your rewards.

Premium account gives you x1,65 bonus XP, free XP and captain XP, as well as x1,5 credits. There are also various economic bonuses you can mount on your ship.

Credits: they are earned mostly based on the relative damage dealt to enemy ships (in other words, damage is calculated by % of the target's max HP pool dealt), as well as the tier difference between your ship and the enemy. For example, 10k damage to a DD is worth about 25k damage to a cruiser, or about 50k damage to a BB. What this means is, if you have a choice of targets to damage reliably, you should go for the target of the highest tier with the lowest total HP pool, unless you have more immediate threats pressuring you.
As far as ships for grinding credits are concerned, the best premium ships are T9 ones. I recommend Kearsarge as your first T9 purchase because it is available completely for free, and is the most overpowered T9 premium currently available. Other recommended T9 premiums include Tulsa, Carnot, Groningen and Neustrashimy (you can find the full list of recommendations on the bottom of this document). If you don’t have the patience to grind coal or free XP for a T9 premium or aren’t willing to spend that much money, consider getting a T8 or lower premium. Note that T5 and lower premiums earn way too little credits and are as such not worth investing into.
If you are unwilling or unable to invest into premium ships, have a few T6 and 7 tech tree ships because they bring the most profit out of all tech tree ships. You won’t lose money with lower tier ships, but you will usually break even with T8s, and lose money regularly with T9 and 10. That’s how the game’s economy and business model are designed, and it encourages you to invest into premium ships and/or premium time.
Before you decide on buying a premium ship, I have to ask you: Please do not buy your way into high tiers. You are better off grinding your way into the high tier tech tree ships because you will gradually learn the game and have better fighting chances than suddenly jumping into a completely unknown metagame.

XP: Ship-bound XP is awarded on similar principles to credits (relative damage and tier difference), with the added bonus of an extra 15% of a ship’s worth of XP being awarded for a kill. What this means is, you get 115% XP for killing a ship from full HP to 0. In order to maximise XP gains, you should focus on finishing off your targets, but not “kill stealing” because that will end the game too quickly.

Free XP and elite captain XP: 10% of earned base XP is mirrored to the free XP pool, and you can increase the earnings with the same methods as for ship-bound XP. The most efficient way to earn free and captain XP, however, is to play Clan battles in a team with a high win rate because every winning player is rewarded 2500 base XP, which is equivalent to an exceptionally good game in a T10 ship in random battles.
Also note that when you eventually bring a captain to level 21, all captain XP earned by him will be transferred to the elite XP pool.

Coal: This is a time-gated resource because there is a limit of how much you can earn per day. The fastest way to earn coal is to collect all available daily resource containers, each of which gives you a minimum of 400 coal, or minimum 1200 coal per day, but you will usually get 1600 coal on average. You can also complete daily recurring missions for an additional 400 coal, which will yield you 2000 average coal per day. At this pace, it will take you about 4-5 months to earn enough coal for a T9 premium with a coupon applied.
There are other ways to get coal. Look out for temporary missions (usually when Brawls are available) and Dockyard stages that reward coal.

Steel: This is an exclusive resource that you earn via ranked and clan battles. You can earn up to 11000 steel during a CB season, and up to 6200 steel per ranked season. If you want to know more about CBs and ranked, please look up the respective articles on the WoWs wiki or your regional WoWs portal."
Yurra,Destroyer guides,"IJN torpedoboat guide
- these ship's role in battle is contesting caps by leveraging their superior concealment against enemy DDs, scouting and torpedo attacks against large ships
- they have weak guns, but they are still not to be ignored - use them when you are spotted by a DD and are about to go behind island cover or smoke up
- due to the combination of their small size, great agility, high HE damage and a rear-heavy turret setup, they can punch well above their weight in terms of HP and gun power, but you should still avoid fighting dedicated gunboat DDs
- their optimal engagement distance vs enemy DDs is around 7-10 km, and only if you’re fighting DDs with substantially worse ballistics because most other DDs either have comparable ballistics with better DPM or straight up better ballistics
- your torps have high damage but slow reload, so make sure your torpedo marksmanship is on point (refer to the torpedo marksmanship guide here: https://imgur.com/a/SJpbq )
- your job in the early game is to contest caps and use your best in class conceal to leverage an advantage vs enemy DDs, but you depend on allied supporting fire in order to get an advantage - this is best done by either entering the cap diagonally and turning away, or reversing your way into the cap if it's a small one
- as with every DD, before you enter a cap, look at the enemy lineup and make sure you know where enemy radars are
- if you don't know where at least one of them is, assume they're at your cap and don't be hasty with capping as you don't have any ability to recover damage
- save your engine boost for when you need to run or reposition to the other side of the map
- use smokes to disengage from fights you can't escape quickly from or in the mid to late game to farm damage with your guns when you can't use cover
- in the mid game, look to keep enemy DDs in check or move to another flank if your flank's enemy side is running away (it's much more difficult to land torps on ships moving away)
- in the late game, look to mop up lone targets and out-cap the enemy team
- specific to Yamagiri: 
never, ever use your 20 km torps because they’re spotted from the moon, easy to dodge and are, as such, hot garbage
use your burst fire in conjunction with your standard fire - fire 2-3 standard fire volleys, then use your burst fire and disengage; this technique will make sure you trade favourably vs most DDs
IJN gunboat guide
- IJN gunboats (Akizuki and above) are primarily DPS DDs, which means you should stay away from caps if you can help it 
- their guns have exceptionally high HE pen (30 mm), which allows them to penetrate most cruiser midsection plating in their MM spread, as well as making IFHE a viable skill for Akizuki and Kitakaze 
- their optimal engagement distance vs enemy DDs is 6-10 km due to their ballistics becoming floaty past 10 km; you should engage larger ships in open water past 10 km because these ships are large and unwieldy (by DD standards)
- their torps are seldom useful, mostly in cases when you can ambush the enemy or when the enemy is pushing towards you 
- in the early game, look to provide fire support to friendly DDs capping or go about doing some early damage against enemy cruisers and BBs on the flanks 
- look to do damage from the safety of island cover first, then from smoke, and only resort to open water gunboating if you are engaging 1v1 at a comfortable range because, again, these DDs are very unwieldy 
- before you smoke up, make sure you are angled against the most likely direction of incoming enemy torps, and don't smoke up in front of submarines because they can blind ping you when you're firing from smoke and flush you out with torps 
- use engine boost when you need to reposition, run from smoke quickly or when you're open water gunboating 
- when fighting broadside enemy DDs, and lightly armored cruisers and BBs at close range, swap to AP because it does about 50% more damage than HE 
- in the mid to late game, you can consider capping if you won't risk getting killed for it and if you can handily beat whichever DD might be at the cap you're looking towards
USN DD guide
- until T8, USN DDs have the 2nd best gunpower in tier at close range, beaten only by French DDs, which means you should try to play around getting into close range and overpowering enemy DDs with your guns, preferably while being close to cover you can duck behind 
- learn which DDs can outspot you and which ones you can outgun so you know when you can contest a cap
- your job in the early game is to contest caps using your gunpower to force enemy DDs away and trade favourably; the optimal engagement distance against enemy DDs is basically as close as possible due to their ballistics being worst in class (don’t try to engage past 9 km)
- have your butt pointed towards the enemy by either reversing into a small cap or entering a large cap and turning out before stopping and reversing 
- look to contest from positions that allow you to duck into hard cover quickly and don't be hasty with capping - before you enter a cap, look at the enemy lineup and make sure you know where enemy radars are 
- if you don't know where at least one of them is, assume they're at your cap and again don't be hasty 
- save your engine boost for when you need to run or reposition to the other side of the map 
- use smokes to disengage from fights you can't take and can't escape quickly from, or in the mid to late game to farm damage with your guns when you can't use cover 
- when you smoke up to farm, point your ship away from the most likely direction of incoming torps and try to have your engine boost running so you can accelerate out of harm's way quickly 
- Mahan gets access to torps whose range exceeds your max conceal range, meaning you can practice stealth torping when opening up with guns is unfavorable 
- Benson and above no longer have relatively good firepower but their torps get better and better, so you should be employing stealth torping more often as you go up the tiers and be more mindful of who you engage with your guns
- specific to Humphreys: use your burst fire mode only when disengaging or losing a target for about 35 seconds
Sherman guide
- early game, play like a small cruiser and look to farm damage from range or support friendly DDs capping 
- however, if you see a cap you can contest by using islands to get within hydro range of an enemy DD, do try and contest it 
- like any DD, make sure that you're not pressured by radar and have a safe way out of the cap 
- it is especially important to make sure you aren't caught close to an enemy push because Sherman is very slow and you will get run over by everything, even BBs 
- if you are on a weak flank, it is best to stick to friendly forces at a safe distance from the enemy while you farm damage in open water or from smokes; you can engage enemies basically at any distance because her ballistics are that good, but ideally you want to create distance when engaging enemy DDs in order to have at least some chance of dodging their shots
- in the late game, try to mop up any enemy DDs by ambushing them around islands; beware of certain DDs like Kleber, Vampire, Ragnar or Smaland because you don't stand much of a chance against them; try not to lose too much HP by late game so you are able to fight enemy DDs 
- use SAP most of the time, and use HE when you're facing a heavily angled ship or a heavily armored one; if you are fighting ships with 38+ mm of armor plating, look to set a fire with HE before swapping to SAP in order to maximise your damage output 
- you can farm damage from open water if you are far away from the enemy and not under too much pressure; otherwise, use island cover or smokes to avoid damage 
- if you're not using SI, use your smokes very conservatively because you only have 2 of them; SI is not mandatory if you are good at managing your engagements 
- use hydro if you're under high threat of being torped in your smoke and when fighting enemy DDs at point blank range
KM DD guide (Z branch)
- KM main branch DDs generally have subpar concealment until T9, so you will have to resort to contesting caps when you can close the distance with the enemy DDs enough to get them into your hydro range, or when an enemy DD makes the mistake of smoking up without having any spotting on you, allowing you to close in and hydro them - your hydro + smoke combo is your win condition against enemy DDs and very few DDs can contest German DDs when playing on their terms
- if you can't close the distance with the enemy in any way, resort to farming damage or head for another cap; your optimal engagement distance is up to 10 km vs enemy DDs, and 8-12 km vs larger ships (make sure you know your matchups well because German DD HE DPM is poor)
- as with all other DDs, make sure you contest caps while in a kiting stance (bow away, ready to run if need be) if you decide to contest in open water
- make sure you have hydro and engine boost running when contesting caps and expecting to fight enemy DDs in order to maximise your chances of dodging enemy torps
- shoot enemy DDs with HE, unless they are armored DDs like Z-31, Märker, Schultz, Elbing, Paolo Emilio, Gearing or Khabarovsk because your AP will overpenetrate broadside DDs that have no armor
- also try using AP whenever you're farming dmg and have a go at an enemy's broadside, you can farm lots of penetration damage against enemy upper sides
- don’t forget to use your torps when enemy ships are in range or pushing towards you
- be wary of enemy radars and hydros, make sure your own hydro doesn't bait you into dying
you will spend most of the mid game farming damage, and as the late game approaches you may still have to do some DD cleanup so make sure you don't spend all of your hydro and smoke charges (abusing island cover when farming dmg helps conserve smokes)
KM DD guide (Elbing branch)
- forget about capping early and mid game (except maybe Z-31 cause she has decent conceal for some reason), that's not gonna happen with your concealment, size and agility, rather find a friendly DD you can support with accurate fire
- you need to be very careful when you engage, and where you are facing when you engage because you take ages to turn your ship, being caught bow-in is almost a death sentence; because of their size, unwieldiness, relatively low DPM and extremely high accuracy, their optimal engagement range is 10+ km
- you should be using AP ~80% of the time, use HE only when you have no other targets than bow-in ship and against enemy DDs (you can't AP pen DDs unless they are armored DDs like German gunboats, Khaba or Paolo)
- these ships are exceptionally accurate, so your aim needs to be on point
- drop torpedoes ahead of enemies that are pushing, or in some typical early and mid game torpedo lanes - they reload quickly so you can spam them pretty often
- most of your damage will be done from the cover of smoke, resort to open water gunboating when you have like 1 or 2 ships that can shoot you; make sure you deploy your smokes in positions that (almost) make sure there won't be torps coming your way, and in positions where you will be most likely to shoot enemy sides (kind of like when you're playing RN CLs with smoke)
-don't get overconfident because of your massive HP pool, you will die quickly because your armour is not good enough and because the HP pool merely compensates for these ships’ immmense size
- don't be afraid of open water duels with enemy DDs unless they are Germans or IJN gunboats - your armour will make sure that you will get the upper hand in most DD fights you get into as long as you are the one kiting and making sure you don't eat torps
- later on in the game, you can go about capping unguarded caps if they’re not too far, but your primary role is still to deal damage
RN DD guide
- RN DDs have good conceal across the board (except at T10), which means you can leverage a spotting advantage against most of their peers in open water cap contests (as always, you should contest by reversing towards the enemy) in case you can't outgun them (RN DDs generally have pretty good guns)
- you can also pop a few volleys at the enemy, make them shoot back and smoke up to quickly disappear (lots of smoke charges help with that a lot) in order to win trades in the long run
- Jutland and Daring get heals on top, which makes them exceptionally good at winning trades vs DDs
- their optimal engagement range vs enemy DDs is 6-10 km; beware not to engage enemy DDs with good ballistics at longer distances
- make sure to use your hydro when you suspect an enemy DD is nearby, just to make sure you or your friendlies don't eat torps
- use your smokes both defensively and offensively, to disengage from fights you can't hope to win and to get a bit of gun damage in on larger enemy ships
- don't try to use your hydro aggressively because it's extremely short ranged and the buffer between your own smoke fire penalty and the hydro's detection range is extremely small
- considering they have built-in warp drive acceleration, you can stop-start dodge enemy fire better than most other DDs, and considering they retain a lot of speed in turns you can also dodge by steering quite efficiently if you move away from the enemy at some 20° angle and reactively dodge their shots
- after you've won early game cap control (or were forced away from the cap by too much enemy presence; don't overstay your welcome!), resort to farming damage off larger ships (use AP liberally on Jutland and Daring as it has improved ricochet angles) or torping ships that are pushing towards you
- make sure you don't forget to keep enemy DDs in check later in the game as needed
- despite them being short ranged, don't forget to use your torps when enemies are pushing towards you or in situations when you can't use your guns
Druid guide
- your role in battle is a DPS DD that predominantly goes after cruisers, lightly armored BBs and DDs
- your early-game thought process should be about one of the following:
can I use islands to get close and ambush an enemy DD while limiting my engagement angles vs other ships?
where can I farm early aggressors safely from?
- your AP ballistics and penetration are surprisingly good, unlike what the calibre suggests, so you can use it quite effectively even at max range; just avoid shooting KM and VMF BBs if you don't have to
- don't be discouraged by the fact that you only get to fire AP - shooting AP at enemy DDs that are running away can still do a bit of damage by hitting their flat stern or superstructure and, more importantly, it forces them into keeping a certain angle, which makes their movement much more predictable and makes shooting the DD easier for your teammates
- abuse line of sight to avoid getting spotted in any way you can, your turrets allow you to do it easily because of the all-forward arrangement (you can peek your front turrets around steep islands without getting spotted, while a teammate does all the spotting)
- don't be afraid to aggress into enemy DDs that have little or no support, your conceal ain't too subpar and you are extremely hard to kill in general
- go for cap contesting when the enemy team has thinned out, and the risk of being outspotted by a more stealthy enemy DD is smaller
- use hydro pretty much whenever there's even a slight chance of torps passing by, and use smokes liberally when farming or disengaging
VMF DD guide (Khabarovsk, Delny branch and the main branch)
- these ships are DPS-type gunboats, which means they are primarily damage dealers
-  in the early game, your role in battle is to provide fire support to friendly DDs capping because your ship is not suitable for it due to concealment issues
- if there are no DDs to support, go wide to a flank and try to annoy stragglers, but make sure you lose little HP because you'll need it later on
- the optimal engagement distance against enemy DDs is 8+ km; against larger ships, as far as reasonably possible
- in the mid game, focus on farming damage and drawing enemy fire away from your team, but make sure not to overdo it or you'll find yourself quickly sinking to the bottom with little contribution to the win
- as the game transitions to its late stage, you should look to cap unguarded caps and ambush enemy DDs when you get the opportunity
- considering the low tier ships’ torps are short ranged and can't possibly exceed your max conceal range, you will have to rely on guns to do the bulk of damage
- Kiev and above are much more flexible because their torps allow them to be useful even when they can't open fire with guns
- the choice of smoke vs repair on the high tier ships is entirely up to you, but you will have to make modifications to your playstyle depending on which you pick (without smoke, play further away and don't risk getting into situations where you will end up having to use smoke to disengage)
- specific to Zorkiy, use your burst fire when: 
fighting cruisers (it grants your HE shells a penetration bonus which allows you to pen up to 32 mm plating)
when an enemy DD is caught out by friendly radar
when disengaging and you’re sure you won’t reengage for the next 40 seconds
when finishing off a low HP DD and are not forced to continue engaging
Neustrashimy guide
- quite unlike other RU DDs, Neustrashimy is a stealthy hybrid with extremely high survivability, and your main job is to control caps by outlasting and outspotting enemy DDs
- your guns may be weak, but your massive effective HP pool means you can punch well above your weight and trade favourably in the short and long term; you should engage enemy DDs at a distance where your ballistics give you the effective DPM advantage, roughly 8+ km
- in the early game, you should contest the nearest cap and, as with other universal type DDs, look at the enemy lineup and make sure you know where enemy radars are - if you don't know where at least one of them is, assume they're at your cap and don't be hasty with capping
- save your engine boost for when you need to run or reposition to another flank, or in rare cases when you’re open water gunboating a lone target (Neustrashimy’s base speed is low so your dodging game needs to be on point)
- in the mid and late game, use your superior conceal to ambush enemy DDs if that’s what it takes to win the game, or resort to farming damage with guns and torps - you may either shoot lone targets from open water, or use smokes to farm when the risk of attracting too much heat is too great
- use your torps often, they reload reasonably quickly and have good damage
- you can use your heals under fire, when you’re at about half to 2/3 healing capacity
- even though your AA is miles away from good, you can use your DFAA for ""AA-trapping"" - keep your AA off until enemy planes spot you, then activate your DFAA and use the priority sector as they pass over to the other side of your ship or as they turn around - you will inflict some long-term planelosses and may deter the enemy CV from coming for you again
FR DD guide
Early game, use solid cover to get close to a cap where you can ambush an enemy DD, lash out in front of the enemy DD and smash them with your reload booster as you turn away and run for the nearest piece of cover. FR DDs are so fast that you can usually pull such things off before the enemy support has time to properly position and react. Always plan your approach so that you end up behind solid cover right after you smash the enemy DD and make sure as few enemy ships as possible can shoot you. If you can't pull that off without losing a lot of HP, you should look to support a friendly DD's cap contest or farm some damage off the enemy while avoiding taking damage.

After that, depending on how the game develops, how many enemies and friendlies are on your flank, and whether there is any cover you can abuse to farm enemies, either go farm the enemy with guns (if you are healthy enough and if there is very few ships that can shoot you) or, preferably, with torps (their damage is much more impactful), try to ambush enemy ships trying to break through, pick off stragglers, yolo-rush ships that are yoloable (FR DDs are some of the best yolo DDs in the game), and try to ambush enemy DDs whenever you have the chance. Use your reload boosters when you have opportunities to deal high amounts of impactful damage, such as when encountering cruiser broadsides, stationary bow-in cruisers and DDs at close range. When fighting enemy DDs, look to create some distance in order to have an advantage in both effective damage output (T8+ FR DD ballistics are some of the best in the game for DDs) as well as dodging.

In case there is a USN, RN CV or a Kaga on the game, hold back until you know where he's operating because these can fuck you up real good with HE DBs. In case he's far from your side of the map, proceed to do your usual stuff. If you see an opening, you can attempt to snipe the enemy CV, Kleber is extremely effective at that as long as you approach him while concealed. If the enemy CV is on your side, you can either farm from the safety of friendly AA, go to another cap/flank or look for openings and torp opportunities. Operate around the map borders and try not to get spotted because CVs tend to get hell-bent on killing you.
Marceau specifics
- Marceau is better off farming damage early game unless you can do a really good ambush
- your optimal engagement range against DDs is much shorter due to bad ballistics and extremely high DPM, usually up to 9 km
- your yolo rush options are more limited because your torps do less dmg, but your stealth torping options are better when you get the chance because your torps have longer range and are slower 
- you can easily farm dmg from island cover due to your high arcs, but your long range farming is less efficient and overall you do less dmg per game than with Kleber 
- don't be fooled by having better AA + DFAA, you still won't stop CV strikes but at least you will shoot down a few more planes
EU DDs (Halland branch)
- the Halland branch DDs have both decent guns and great torps, but they should not engage guns very often due to the inability to disengage from unfavourable engagements which mandates high trigger discipline and careful pathing 
- only engage enemy DDs in a 1v1 when:
1) you are certain you can outgun them by a fair margin 
2) when you are absolutely certain nobody else can interfere and swing the balance in the enemy's favour 
3) when your ballistics won’t bring you to a disadvantaged position, which is usually below 9 km
- in other cases, engage guns on larger ships when they’re distracted or when you can abuse island cover
- your torps have low damage but fast reload, high speed and very tight spreads, which makes them quite forgiving
- use the super narrow spreads when you are certain that you will hit your target, like very predictable targets at close distances or bow-in targets, and use the standard narrow spreads when you are torping targets from further away (make sure to overlap them, but not completely)
- nevertheless, make sure your torpedo marksmanship is on point (https://imgur.com/a/SJpbq )
- your job in the early game is to contest caps and throw torps at targets of opportunity
- before you enter a cap, look at the enemy lineup and make sure you know where enemy radars are; if there are radars that are unaccounted for, you have to approach the cap from a direction where you will be able to scout the enemy's radar position or escape quickly from without taking much damage, or drop the cap altogether until enemy radars are accounted for - assume they're at your cap and don't be hasty with capping
- in the mid game, look to keep enemy DDs in check or move to another flank if your flank's enemy side is running away
- in the late game, look to mop up lone targets and out-cap the enemy team
- save your engine boost for when you need to run or reposition to the other side of the map
- you can use your heals early mid-fight so that you have time to make use of its full duration during the fight
- use your DFAA for ""AA-trapping"" - keep your AA off until enemy planes spot you, then activate your DFAA and use the priority sector as they pass over to the other side of your ship or as they turn around

EU DDs (Gdansk branch)
- these ships are DPS-type gunboats, much like most Soviet DDs; however, the high tier ships bring a spicy short cooldown and short duration radar to the table, which makes these ships’ optimal playstyle a bit different
- in the early game, your job is to delay an enemy DD capping the nearest cap - sit patiently outside the cap but make sure it’s entirely covered by your radar range; once an enemy DD enters the cap, use your radar in order to deal damage to the enemy DD and hopefully chase them away from the cap (don’t expect to kill them due to the radar’s short duration)
- don’t spend all your radars in the early game - save at least 2 charges for the late game in order to be able to damage enemy DDs that are shadowing you in open water
- in the mid game, use your superb guns to farm large amounts of damage, either from open water or from the safety of your smoke
- in the late game, try to clean up any leftover enemy DDs, or keep farming damage
- you torpedoes are an afterthought, use them only in case an enemy is close enough, pushing towards you and you can’t use your guns
- considering their engine boost has a relatively short duration, you should use it more carefully - when under high intensity fire and need to escape, or when you need to get to a point quickly
- if you play these ships properly and if your build is optimised, you will find yourself not using your smoke often due to their good speed and high effective range
Friesland/Groningen guide
- your primary job is to farm as much damage as possible using your guns, be it from smokes or island cover, and your secondary job is making enemy DDs' lives miserable if you get the opportunity to do so
- due to your floaty ballistics, you should engage DDs at close range, usually below 9 km; engage larger ships in open water only at 12+ km due to her subpar dynamics
- in the early game, see if the nearest cap has an island you can use to close the distance undetected and contest the cap, and see if you can put your hydro + smoke combo to good use against an enemy DD (beware of radars and other hydro DDs except RN DDs) 
- if not, you should look to farm enemy ships from a safe position
- before you smoke up to farm shit, think about whether there's nearby island cover you can use to block line of sight instead
- don't smoke up to farm in pushable positions because you don't have torps and can, as such, be rushed down by anything with higher survivability or DPM
- don't open water gunboat unless you're fighting a lone BB because Friesland is very slow by DD standards and doesn't have engine boost to aid in dodging by acceleration
- use hydro when you either want to make sure you won't eat torps from enemy DDs, or when you want to spot and overpower enemy DDs from within smoke
- use your DFAA for ""AA-trapping"" - keep your AA off until enemy planes spot you, then activate your DFAA and use the priority sector as they pass over to the other side of your ship or as they turn around

Ragnar guide
- Ragnar's primary job is to farm large amounts of damage and shit on cruisers, because it's basically a very small cruiser without a citadel
- your main battery is extremely accurate and your HE shells penetrate 30 mm armor which makes your damage output against larger ships much more potent than raw DPM would suggest, but it also means your gunnery needs to be on point
- your optimal engagement range is 8-13 km - your ballistics are good but you may struggle to hit moving cruisers at max range (and definitely DDs)
- use AP against broadside cruisers and BBs at distances below 10 km, like you would with other CLs
- don’t head straight for caps in the early game, rather assume a good position behind an island or on a flank and wait for enemy ships to start engaging friendlies before you open up; you can also shadow friendly DDs and support their capping operations, but don’t be the first one to get spotted because you will lose too much HP which you will need for the late game
- when you start getting shot at, pop your engine boost and use the superb speed, acceleration and deceleration it provides to dodge enemy fire and increase your survivability
- later on, use your engine boost to reposition to other flanks or engage enemy cruisers in open water combat
- be afraid of cruisers with exceptional ballistics like Moskva, Nevsky, Petro or Venezia, and don’t engage them in direct combat
- later in the game, when the situation demands it, go about mopping up enemy DDs - you can beat any DD except other Ragnars, and Elbings at distances above 10 km; be careful with broadside exposure against German DDs, RN DDs and IJN gunboats
- you can “AA-trap” enemy CVs - wait for the planes to spot you with your AA off, then press P to activate your AA, and use the priority sector only after the planes pass over to the other side or turn around
Smaland guide
- Smaland is both a universal-type and a DPS-type DD in one package, which makes her the strongest T11 T10 DD
- due to her ballistics being typical for EU DDs, her optimal engagement range vs DDs is up to 9 km; engage larger ships in open water combat at 11+ km
- early-game, you can either go to the nearest cap and try to ambush an enemy DD at surface detection range or get to farming BBs and cruisers right away
- despite having heals and generally being the strongest T10 DD, beware of radars and scout out their most common positions before you commit to a cap
- when ambushing DDs, radar them only if they use smoke or if they haven’t fired their guns at you and are about to get out of their surface detection range
- your torps have good range and speed so fling them at larger enemy ships at every opportunity
- use engine boost when running away from engagements, open water gunboating enemy ships focusing on you or when changing flanks
- in the mid to late game, focus on farming damage or mopping up enemy DDs if there is a chance you might lose the game
- despite your incredible firepower and survivability, be afraid of cruisers with exceptional ballistics, Marceau, Ragnar, Elbing, Kleber and Khaba; take extra care if you’re engaging DDs with superior ballistics while your engine boost is down because Smaland is not a very hard ship to hit
IT DD guide
- despite what their stats or WG’s recommendations might lead you to believe, these ships are gunboat DPS-type DDs, not torpedoboats
- they have very high damage but short ranged guns that carry HE and SAP shells - you use SAP against anything that gives you enough angle to penetrate, and you use HE against anything that doesn’t
- their playstyle in the early game consists of looking for a position they can ambush an enemy DD from - they can either fly into a cap using their engine boost, burst an enemy DD down and run away using their exhaust smoke, or by popping out from behind an island and doing the same
- your torps have quick reload and long range, so make sure you fling them at targets for chip damage and forcing out DCPs
- in the mid and late game, try to take unguarded caps and burst down larger enemy ships
- since most of these ships have to be in dangerous proximity to large enemy ships in order to use their guns, even with AFT skilled, you will often have to dip in and out of firing range, or open fire while using your engine boost, or resort to farming from smoke
- be extremely wary of Soviet CA/Ls because none of these DDs have enough range to stay outside of their radar, which will mandate that you force their radar before you engage them from within smoke; smart Soviet CA/L players will usually not use their radar unless you're capping while concealed, or unless they've been suddenly spotted in open water
- your optimal engagement range against DDs is basically the further, the better, because of their good ballistics 
- these ships aren't particularly fast without their engine boost running so be very careful who you fight while the engine boost is down
"
Yurra,Cruiser guides,"USN CA guide
- early-game you sneak up behind a DD, support them while they cap with your radar, and engage only when you're already in a kiting stance (use islands near the cap to cover the cap with your radar before you come out of cover)
- in the mid and late game, you should focus on mopping up enemy cruisers, and DDs if they threaten your chances of winning the game
- your optimal engagement range is 11-15 km, even though you can comfortably hit targets at max range (stock max range; please for the love of god don’t use range mod on T9-11)
- try not to get shot and focus on doing damage to DDs, cruisers and BBs, in that order of priority; DM and Buffalo can afford to take some fire because they get a huge upgrade in the form of Repair; the T8 and above USN CAs can bow-tank 380 mm and smaller calibre BBs because their entire hulls are plated in at least 27 mm armour
- if you need to push, don't do it alone and make sure you have hydro up and running when you're sailing towards an enemy DD or when you're in a relatively safe position with a high chance of an enemy DD torping you
- USN CA AP is extremely potent with high DPM and excellent ricochet angles, so you should use it liberally at distances below 14 km, just make sure that the cruiser or BB you're shooting is not too angled for you to penetrate
(pls just don't spam AP at bow-in ships)
- abuse cover often because your ballistics allow you to lob shells over many islands; you can get quite creative with positioning
- specific to Annapolis, use your burst fire mode when 1) you’re disengaging and won’t reengage for at least the next 40 seconds 2) when you see an opportunity to utterly destroy an enemy broadside cruiser, but aren’t forced to continue engaging after emptying your autoloader

Alaska guide
- your job is smashing enemy broadsides and occasionally defending caps from enemy DDs
- in the early game, take a position that will allow you to catch enemy broadsides and create a crossfire with other big gun ships on your team
- think about using your radar in the early stages only if you can get close enough using island cover, and if you can bail out safely
- as the game progresses, you should attempt to fight at closer ranged and take space from the enemy using your survivability and radar
- in the late game, you may attempt to hunt enemy DDs
- your main ammo type is AP, it is usable for like 2/3 of your play time due to incredibly good ricochet angles (the rule of thumb is, if the enemy can fire all turrets at you, you can use AP - there are very few exceptions to this rule 
- swap to HE for stubbornly angled targets that you can't overmatch, or DDs
- your radar is an afterthought, so don't play around trying to make it work - rather use it opportunistically
- your citadel is placed very low in the water, so you may sometimes get away with a ""gamer turn"" without taking too much damage (don't show your broadside deliberately!)
USN CL guide
- much like USN CAs, your main job in the early game is supporting friendly DDs, but you need to be more careful when going about it because you’re relatively squishy for a cruiser
- also much like USN CAs, aim to deal damage by using island cover; you are more of a DPS cruiser than a utility one because your DPS is higher and the high tiers don’t have quite as much radar range so some radar positions that you can use with the USN CAs won’t work for the CLs
- their optimal engagement distance vs cruisers is below 13 km, and 12-15 km vs BBs (BBs are easier to hit and you need to be at a distance where you can dodge their fire comfortably)
- in the mid to late game, look to hunt enemy DDs down and mop up enemy cruisers with your DPM at close range
- in general, try not to get shot and let the others tank the damage for you
- use HE unless a broadside opens up at very close range (like sub 8 km)
- abuse cover often because your ballistics allow you to lob shells over many islands, but your high shell arcs will also demand high aiming skill from you; you have to be quite creative with your positioning and have good aim in order to get the most out of your damage output
- DFAA and hydro usage is pretty straightforward, use DFAA when a CV commits to a strike on you or a nearby friendly with bombers or TBs, and use hydro when you’re at high risk of being torped or when pushing with your friendlies
Austin guide
- you're a fire support ship - your job is to do damage and not get shot at, this is best done by using friendlies as meatshields, or avoiding line of sight by using island cover or friendly smokes 
- your gameplay will mostly consist of doing damage in bursts when your reload booster is available, with some occasional constant damage output when you can avoid being shot at 
- be very careful when engaging because your HP is low and you are highly prone to exploding to enemy BB fire; you also can't really trade with enemy cruisers because of your low HP, unless you manage to catch them broadside while your reload booster is available
- your ideal engagement range is 12-15 km - you need to be far away rough from the enemy to be able to dodge shells, and your ballistics allow you to engage comfortably at that distance
- don't be afraid to engage in open water, but try not to get shot at by more than 2 ships 
- dodge by using both steering and deceleration, as your ship and turning circle are both very small and comparable to some large DDs 
- use reload boosters when enemies present broadsides or when you really need to outdamage an enemy you're fighting 
- don't forget to use your torps when kiting in stealth, they're Fletcher torps and are as such very good
San Diego guide
- you’re a DPS and fire support ship, your job is to do as much damage as possible while surviving
- unlike Austin, San Diego has quite decent survivability for a T8 CL thanks to her incredible agility, good concealment and Repair, which is sadly unavailable to most T8 CA/Ls - this means you can take fights with enemy cruisers and BBs in open water
- SAP is your primary ammo, whereas AP should only be used against broadsides at close range that you wouldn’t be able to penetrate with SAP (citadel belts at very close range, upper belts with more than 36 mm plating); if an enemy is heavily armored and too far away for AP to be effective, use SAP against their superstructure
- in the early game, stick close to friendly DDs and support them while they cap, and in return they might thank you with providing you a smoke (don't count on it, though)
- in the mid and late game, look to destroy enemy cruisers at medium and close range - you have a repair which means you will outtrade a lot of T8 cruisers at your optimal engagement range (10-14 km)
- you can also try sneaking around islands and ambushing enemy DDs in the late game
- keep a bit further away from BBs in order to be able to dodge their fire in a timely manner
- consumable use is straightforward, use hydro if you expect torpedoes and use DFAA against incoming planes
- use reload boosters against targets you can guarantee large amounts of penetrating hits on, such as broadside cruisers and DDs
IJN CA guide
- your primary role is that of a stealthy, kiting DPS cruiser that excels at supporting friendly DDs
- the best strategy for the early game is to shadow a friendly DD by keeping some 5-7 km behind them, so that they're the first ones to spot an enemy DD and get spotted before you do
- don't open fire before your ship is angled away from the enemy - once you're properly angled and kiting, slap the enemy DD with your superbly accurate guns
- these ships are exceptionally accurate, so your aim needs to be on point, and this also means you will have less stray shells hitting if you narrowly miss your target
- in the mid and late game, look to do damage to enemy cruisers and BBs
- their ideal engagement range is 11-14 km, except for Zao which likes to engage from a bit further away due to her excellent ballistics
- you will be rewarded if your angling game is on point because Furutaka, Aoba, Myoko and Atago have thick decks that allow them to bounce BB AP, unlike most of their peers (Mogami, Ibuki and Zao don't have that luxury so you will have to resort to dodging in order to avoid damage)
- keep large enemy ships or DDs whose positions you know about about your detection range's distance worth away, and learn when to disengage (don't overstay your welcome); re-engage when the enemy shift their attention to friendly ships
- use AP against broadside cruisers and HE against everything else
- if the enemy is pushing into you, try flinging your torps at them (keep in mind the poor torpedo launcher arcs)
- use hydro over DFAA because you won't meet CVs every game and your AA isn't very good
Tone specifics
- not quite like the typical IJN CA not only because of planes, but because she doesn't have their typically strong deck armour or gun power
- the way to go about playing Tone is similar to IJN CAs in the way that you support friendly DDs while they cap in the early game, and your gameplay mostly consists of kiting and doing dmg (see the IJN CA guide for more details on this part)
- her optimal engagement range is a bit different, 12-15 km, as you need to put more emphasis on surviving
- when fighting enemy DDs you want to be some 10 km away in order to maximise your chances of hitting them, and at such a distance you will usually be far away enough to dodge BB fire
- use your torps as you would with other IJN CAs
- how to use planes:
when you need to spot an enemy DD nearby for your teammates and yourself to shoot, you can hover above them, strike and cancel the animation with a double click for a chance to shoot him yourself while he's still spotted
doing damage to enemy ships while you can't engage them with guns for any reason, and preferably to ships that have their DCP on cooldown 
spotting any enemy ship in cases where you're not in a position to engage, and when spotting the enemy for some time will have a greater impact than simply attacking them
don't use them on cooldown because their cooldown is rather long and their damage is rather weak
try to attack isolated targets because the planes' HP is low
Kitakami guide
- at the start of the game, pop engine boost assume a flank position and shoot your first torp payload into the enemy spawn, or wherever enemy BBs are most likely to go in early game
- avoid caps in order to avoid getting your ship or torps spotted by the enemy DD
- if you manage to get spotted, are in a position to dodge, and aren't targeted by too many enemies, don't blow your smoke immediately and rather resort to dodging
- otherwise, pop smoke, especially if an enemy CV is riding you
- prioritise targeting BBs, then cruisers
- don't fire your torps on cooldown, rather have 2 or 3 launchers ready before you strike
- don't have all your tubes loaded either, it's a sign you're mispositioning and/or wasting time
- if you have a lot of tubes loaded, fire 2 at a time in order to try and force DCP to cause follow-up floods
- you can use smoke to farm damage with guns in end game situations or when you are sure you will not need the smoke for the duration of its cooldown interval
- you can try fighting some DDs with weaker and average guns, just be extra wary of those with improved AP or high penetration HE
KM CA guide
- German cruisers are primarily DPS cruisers, and are (with the exception of Hipper and Eugen) some of the best damage dealers in the game across most tiers due to their high penetration HE shells, good range, ballistics, HE DPM and high AP damage
- early game, do as you would with other DPS cruisers - support friendly DDs in caps while in a kiting stance and do poke damage to larger enemy ships while trying not to lose HP; your optimal engagement range is 12-17 km
- in the mid and late game, aim to deal as much damage to enemy cruisers and BBs as possible, especially ones with good plating (38-50 mm) because most your friendly cruisers will struggle to damage them
- it is especially important to avoid being shot at when playing Königsberg and Nürnberg because they are extremely vulnerable to BB AP - they have high shell arcs so you can use a lot of islands to block line of sight while being able to shoot over them
- use AP against broadside cruisers and BBs (except German BBs, Soyuz and Kremlin due to their very thick upper belts) under 15 km
- forget about using torpedoes unless you're in a situation where you can close the distance against a torpedo-less ship using island cover and pump their face full of torps
- consumable usage is quite straightforward, use hydro when under threat of being torped and use your spotter plane when you lack range to hit something or when you want to spot something over an island at close range; forget about using DFAA because your AA isn’t very good and the consumable itself is quite situational

Mainz specifics
- most of the above points apply to Mainz, with the following differences:
use AP against broadsides at short ranges, mostly below 10 km, or against weakly armoured ships out to 13 km
Mainz’s ballistics are more floaty than on the 203 mm armed cruisers, so you will have more opportunities to block line of sight by using island or smoke cover - constantly think about where you can position to block LoS
your optimal engagement range is shorter, about 11-16 km
VMF CL guide
- Nevsky and co are primarily utility cruisers due to their long range radar and good conceal to radar buffer, with the lower tier cruisers being decent ranged DPS cruisers due to their good range and ballistics
- in the early game, find an island you can use to cover your approach to a cap and turn out as you come out from behind it, then use radar as you're spotted and get some damage on the enemy DD
- in the mid game, spam HE from range (prioritise cruisers as your targets) and, if possible, radar enemy DDs when you have the chance, but don't go out of your way to do so because these ships are not very tanky and you really don't want to be stuck bow in and perma spotted with them
- in the late game, mop up any enemy DDs and finish off low HP targets
- try not to get stuck behind islands because your ballistics are quite flat, which means you will mostly play in open water
- your optimal engagement range is 12-16 km for the 152 mm armed CLs, and 14-18 km for Donskoi and Nevsky 
- don't forget to use your AP against broadsides, Nevsky and Donskoi retain very good pen at range
- be very careful when getting shot at by enemy BBs, especially ones with a large number of 380-420 mm guns because Nevsky is a very large CL and as such has large 25 mm sides
- only use torps as a last resort weapon in close range island ambushes
- on Donskoi and Nevsky, don’t use your radar as soon as you’re spotted in open water because your radar range is shorter than your conceal range (unless you have just come out of cover) - instead, move towards the suspected enemy for about 10 seconds before using radar (and obviously don’t get yourself killed just so you can do damage to a DD)
VMF CA guide (the Novosibirsk branch)
- they are very simple to play, you’re primarily a tank cruiser with some utility in the form of a short duration long range radar
- early game, you try to radar enemy DDs because your max concealment allows you to radar almost as soon as you are spotted, provided you are moving forward - do it in a manner that will get you behind cover or where you appear from around an island corner in a kiting stance; don’t expect much damage and team supporting fire because, again, your radar lasts for a very short time
- later on you go about kiting and tanking, looking for broadsides to exploit or sneaking into positions that allow you to set up crossfires - Riga and Petro excel at punishing sides, but are pretty much useless against angled ships 
- these ships have a unique dispersion pattern that is very tight at close range but gets really inaccurate at distances greater than 14 km, which makes their optimal engagement distance 'as close as possible'
- despite what stories you might have heard about their AP, these ships’ primary ammo is still HE as their AP has barely improved penetration angles - you will not do yourself any favours if you keep spamming AP at bow-in ships
- if there aren’t many ships that can focus you down, you can try making plays by hopping from island to island and exerting pressure on enemy ships or getting into angles that will force crossfires on the enemy
- their guns perform poorly past 14 km because of their crappy dispersion; still, you should look for broadsides to punish at any range because of the amazing AP penetration 
- when playing Riga and Novosibirsk, be very careful when bringing your back turret to a firing solution because their citadels are very vulnerable and their turrets’ maximum firing angles are within ricochet margins for most AP shells in the game

RN CL guide
- their role is DPS and close DD support, or, if you decide to pick radar on high tier ships, you assist DDs in contesting and prevent objectives from being taken
- keep in mind RN CLs are not very newb-friendly because they don't have HE, which means you need to have some knowledge of armour schemes and ricochet mechanics (these shells have improved ricochet angles) in order to use AP to its fullest extent - learn which ships have thick upper belt armour, and learn the ranges and angles at which you can penetrate it (in case you can’t penetrate upper belts or the enemy has angled their ship too much, aim for the superstructure) 
- they're also prone to exploding when BBs give them a funny look due to their armour schemes
- as with most cruisers in the early game, you should follow friendly DDs closely but make sure they're spotted by the enemy DD before you are so that you have time to run your ship away and take aim before engaging; don't engage for too long because you risk getting blasted out of the water by enemy BBs 
- try to take positions that will allow you to shoot enemy in the side, provide close support to DDs, try to do as much relative damage as possible (aka prioritise DDs and cruisers) and try not to get yourself spotted before you smoke up so the enemy can't shoot you with minimap assist 
- your optimal engagement range is about 11-14 km
- there are several things you have to keep in mind before you smoke up to farm damage: 
can you use an island to block line of sight instead of blowing a smoke? 
make sure you're in a position that allows you to have a reasonable go at enemy ships' sides because your ship fires AP only 
make sure you have an escape plan in case you get rushed and in order to avoid get spotted and focused down when your smoke expires 
make sure you are angled against the most likely direction of incoming enemy torps and have your hydro up and running at most 30 s after you've smoked up 
if you're not spotted when you smoke up, don't fire before smoke envelops your ship in order to avoid minimap-assisted blindfire by the enemy 
make sure you move back and forth in order to minimise the chances of blindfire hitting you 
- you can also use smokes in order to disengage, you don't have to stay inside especially if there are enemies pushing towards you 
- you don't have to always use smoke or islands when you engage, it's perfectly fine to do it in open water if you are being shot by 1 or 2 ships, but make sure you steer and change speed when you reactively dodge enemy fire
- use your torpedoes when the enemy is pushing towards you; this is more effective with Neptune, Minotaur and especially Edgar because of their large number of torpedoes and Edgar's long torpedo range
- specific to Edgar, use your burst fire when:
you can obliterate an enemy DD you caught with your radar (or by any other means), while they’re broadside; fire a single normal volley first, then use burst fire
you’re disengaging for at least 30 seconds; you can also hit-and-run by firing several volleys and using burst fire as you’re about to disengage
- if you have equipped radar on your Edinburgh, Minotaur and Edgar (not recommended for Neptune due to large hull and subpar concealment), keep the following things in mind:
you obviously can't use smoke to disengage and farm damage, so you have to shift your focus to using islands or resorting to open water engagements with mad dodging skills if you want to rack up damage numbers
your main role with radar is to control cap zones and make enemy DDs' lives miserable, farming damage is only a matter of opportunity
in order to win fights against cruisers and BBs, you either have to take 1v1 fights or unfair fights where their attention is taken up by something else, or when somebody else is spotting for you while you hide and do damage
you will find that you will be engaging on and off much more often dealing less absolute damage numbers, and using your torps more often
these principles also apply to Brisbane, with even more emphasis on torps, and the fact that you can sometimes use your long range radar preemptively in order to catch an enemy DD heading for a cap or an Arms Race buff 

RN CA guide 
- their role is a kiting tank cruiser, as unlike most cruisers, RN CAs get Repair all the way from T5 onwards, with the high tiers having super Repair, as well as taking into consideration their relatively low damage output
- in the early game, look for a decent kiting position as you would with most other cruisers, or look to obscure line of sight with islands so you can farm the enemy for free
- look to hold your ground for as long as possible, but don’t risk your ship for it, and let teammates take any punishment if you don’t have to - your Repairs are a valuable resource which will come in handy later in the game when you will want to isolate fights against enemy ships, preferably cruisers
- their primary ammo type is HE as it has relatively high damage and good fire chance; only use your AP at close and medium range against enemy cruisers because the penetration is rather poor
- optimal engagement range is relatively short - 10-14 km
- engage BBs from a bit further away for better chances to dodge their fire - you will have to dodge as some of these ships have extremely vulnerable citadels at the bow and stern
- use your torpedoes when kiting or in close range island ambushes against torpedo-less ships
- consumable usage is quite like that of most other cruisers, use hydro when you are at risk of being torped, and forget about DFAA
Commonwealth CA guide
- their role is of a medium range DPS cruiser
- the main way to play these ships is to have an allied ship that will spot enemies for you, while you either use smoke or islands to block line of sight and farm big amounts of damage
- in the early game, you can shadow a friendly DD in order to help them contest an objective, and continue with farming larger enemy ships from safety
- their survivability is comparable to USN CAs, so open water engagements are not preferred and should only be done in situations where you can confidently dodge enemy fire, or as a last resort
- they have decent torpedo range, so try not to forget about them and fling them at enemies moving closer to you
- if you are running away while your smoke is deploying, you can run at half speed and have all your turrets on target without getting spotted
- ammo selection is standard, HE is primary, AP when you can guarantee citadels against broadside cruisers
- optimal engagement range is 10-16 km
FR CA guide (main and Henri sub branch)
- your role is that of a kiting DPS CA - do as much damage as you can to cruisers and BBs in order to maximise your game impact
- at the start of a game, don't engage right away when you see your first target pop up, rather use your conceal to get closer and assume a kiting stance - make sure your detection range doesn't exceed the enemy's edge of the nearest cap so you don't get spotted by a DD before you turn away 
- in the mid and late game, look to out-trade enemy cruisers or farm damage off BBs while dodging their fire - your optimal engagement range is 13+ km because it will allow you to effectively dodge enemy fire
- spam HE at all targets except broadside cruisers (and broadside BBs if you’re playing Henri and Condé) 
- target priority: DDs at close range (sub 12 km) > broadside cruisers > other cruisers > everything else 
- use your engine boost when you are under fire so you can dodge both by acceleration and deceleration as well as steering 
- use your reload booster when you find broadside cruisers, cruisers at relatively close range, and BBs that had just used DCP, in order to set multiple fires
- if an enemy cruiser presents their broadside and you have the wrong ammo loaded, use the Loader skill and your reload booster to quickly swap to AP and punish the enemy
- forget about using torpedoes unless you're in a situation where you can close the distance against a torpedo-less ship using island cover and pump their face full of torps
- specific to Condé: 
only use your alternate fire to delete broadside enemy cruisers off the face of the Earth, or when you expect to disengage for at least 40 seconds
FR CA guide (Marseille sub branch)
- these cruisers excel at one thing, which is punishing enemy broadsides - they are well equipped for this with their high penetration AP and the reload booster consumable
- the way these cruisers are played in the early game is you look for a position where you can pressure the enemy’s side from while having friendly ships nearby that can take the enemy’s attention up, which will enable you to survive and have shots at their sides
- in order to do this effectively, you need good map knowledge and you need to use islands to be able to disengage when needed - identify a good island you can abuse, pop engine boost and send it - your good concealment will allow you to be quite flexible with positioning
- if the map or the team’s deployment doesn’t allow you to do this, roam around, pay real good attention to the minimap, take opportunistic shots at broadsides and look for opportunities to get on the enemy’s side
- don’t be afraid to swap to HE if there are no broadside targets available, but always be ready to swap back to AP; you may unload AP into the enemy’s superstructure if you already have it loaded and want to swap to HE for the next volley
- if you notice a broadside present itself and you have the wrong ammo type loaded, use the Loader skill and your reload booster to quickly swap to AP and punish the enemy for their mistake
- these ships are best played at 13-16 km from the nearest large enemy ship because that distance allows you to effectively dodge cruiser and BB fire by accelerating and decelerating while your engine boost is running; however, your accuracy is subpar for a battlecruiser which means you will be quite ineffective if you keep shooting at targets at max range
- use your hydro as you would with most other cruisers, or when you’re pushing into a forward position
IT CA guide
- the Italians are much like your standard DPS/kiting cruisers, with the main difference from the others being that they have high damage SAP shells and full throttle (“fuel”) smokes
- in the early game, you should be in a kiting stance, looking to blap an enemy DD - you do this by keeping some 6-7 km behind a friendly DD as you expect them to spot an enemy DD for you to shoot, and you don't break your cover before you spot an enemy DD
- SAP damage is very high which means you can slap enemy DDs for 1/3-1/2 of their HP in a single volley, provided they're broadside
-after the early-game, look to do damage to enemy cruisers and lightly armoured BBs
- use SAP 90% of the time, except when you have an opportunity to guarantee citadels on an enemy cruiser or when you have nothing better to shoot than a heavily armoured BB (like a German one)
- be sure to launch your torps often, at enemies pushing towards you, as their long range allows you to get an occasional hit for extra dmg
- be extra wary of enemy DDs and other ships with long range torpedoes as these ships don't have access to hydro
- use smokes to either prolong your survival or eliminate the risk of getting slapped or killed while doing otherwise dangerous moves, like traversing gaps where you are sure to get spotted or making 180° turns in situations where you managed to fuck up and get permanently spotted while bow in
- when using smokes, always keep your smoke firing penalty in mind and have high trigger discipline
Napoli specifics
- the above points apply, except you don’t have SAP and can’t do anywhere near the amount of DD demolishing as the main branch cruisers can
- ammo selection is pretty standard for cruisers, but do note that your AP is quite effective all the way out to around 16 km
- you want to position around the flanks and be a nuisance - you are unkillable, but have very low damage output, so you will be on the defence most of the time
- you can also build into secondaries, in which case the following points will apply:
your damage output will increase, but your survivability will decrease
you will find yourself playing much more sneakily, looking for opportunities to “trap” enemy ships inside secondary range
when you're trying to trap an enemy ship, turn your secondaries off until you're spotted in order to have the enemy already deep within your secondary range (your max secondary range exceeds your max conceal by 700 m, and secondaries will get you spotted at their max range if you leave them on)
you can use the fighter plane and smoke in conjunction to get free secondary damage at close range, just keep in mind your main battery smoke firing penalty

NL CA guide
- your role in battle is that of a DPS cruiser that specialises in punishing stationary ships with airstrikes
- don’t get too aggressive in the early game just to get your airstrikes off ASAP - instead, play as you would with other DPS cruisers - support DDs, get into favourable kiting positions, kite and do damage to enemy ships from a safe distance and position
- your optimal engagement range with the low tier ships is 11-14 km, and 11-16 km starting at Haarlem; if you use the range mod on Gouden Leeuw, your guns can be quite effective all the way out to max range
- once some enemy ship pushes up to an aggressive position, you can start bombarding them with airstrikes - you need to aim your airstrikes as if you were shooting an enemy some 20 km away with your guns
- you can also use airstrikes to slap ships that are moving predictably, preferably with their bow towards or away from you
- be careful when fighting other cruisers with high tier NL CA because they have battlecruiser fire duration (for god knows what reason), and because they have low effective damage output with their guns due to low DPM and poor dispersion; you have fast cooldown Repairs that allow you to offset that fire duration, but you will burn through them very quickly if you're not careful
- use hydro and DFAA as you would on other cruisers
ES CA guide
- these ships are primarily kiting DPS cruisers whose gameplay is spiced up by the burst fire mechanic
- the gameplay loop is similar to most DPS cruisers in the early game - shadow a friendly DD to support their capping operation, or take up a kiting position and start doing damage to larger enemy ships
- the burst fire mechanic comes into play when you have an opportunity to burst an enemy DD that is moving very predictably (such as mid-turning away after being spotted), or when you catch a broadside enemy cruiser; the low tiers benefit from this mechanic less than the high tiers because of its very long reload time and their mediocre ballistics, so use this ability carefully because you will be punished for using it poorly
- the high tiers are well suited for flanking and medium to long range combat due to their high speed, good range, great ballistics and access to the spotter plane - their optimal engagement range is 12-17 km; the lower tiers’ optimal engagement range is 10-15 km

Pan-Asian CL guide
- these ships are primarily fire support ultra-light cruisers with very strong torpedoes at high tiers
- your main role is doing damage while trying to avoid taking any in return, especially from BBs
- below tier 8, look to farm damage from the safety of your smokes or island cover, and fling torps at pushing enemies
- your optimal engagement range is 10-14 km
- at T8+, look to launch your torps and get torp hits before you go about farming with your guns - you can even use something known as “torpedo baiting” - launch torps at where you expect the enemy to turn (not at the lead indicator; take note of their turret positions in order to predict where they are most likely to turn), and fire your guns some 15-20 seconds before you expect your torps to hit
- some high tier DDs like Ragnar, German gunboats, Kleber or Marceau pose a real threat to you due to how low your HP pool is and how bad your ballistics are, so don’t engage them where they have a HP and/or ballistics advantage
- these ships may prove to be very situational due to their poor ballistics and very strong torps - they are excellent kiters and push stallers, but perform very poorly when having to chase - hence why you need to stick to the map middle in the early game and relocate to where the enemy is most likely to push when you have enough intel
- don’t engage enemy cruisers and BBs in open water unless you have a substantial HP advantage over enemy cruisers or unless you’re farming a lone BB which you can dodge quite handily in open water because of your excellent agility
- there are several things you have to keep in mind before you smoke up to farm damage: 
can you use an island to block line of sight instead of blowing a smoke? 
make sure you have an escape plan in case you get rushed and in order to avoid get spotted and focused down when your smoke expires 
if you're not spotted when you smoke up, don't fire before smoke envelops your ship in order to avoid minimap-assisted blindfire by the enemy 
make sure you move back and forth in order to minimise the chances of blindfire hitting you
be extremely wary of any DDs in the vicinity as you don’t have hydro so you have to angle against the most likely direction of incoming torps
Pan-American CL guide
- these ships are primarily tank/DPS CLs with an emphasis on using their Combat instructions to make the best use of their myriad consumables
- the main idea behind playing these ships is sustaining fire on the enemy in order to fill up their Combat instructions bar, before making aggressive plays that use the consumable cooldown reduction that the Combat instructions provide in conjunction with their extremely powerful Repair in order to survive high intensity combat
- in the early game, you should take positions on the flanks and wait for enemy ships to push or have multiple targets within your range before you start engaging in order to be able to sustain fire on the enemy for long enough and fill your Combat instructions up
- once your Combat instructions are ready to activate, you can start looking for more intense engagements, either at close range or against larger numbers of enemy ships
- your optimal engagement range is 12 km to max range in case your Combat instructions are not ready, and 10-14 km in case they are ready
- also think about positioning in places that allow you to create crossfires with allied ships, in order to hit the enemy’s sides (as you only have AP shells)
- much like RN CLs, these ships only have access to AP shells with improved ricochet angles, so similar rules apply: learn which ships have thick upper belt armour, and learn the ranges and angles at which you can penetrate it (in case you can’t penetrate upper belts or the enemy has angled their ship too much, aim for the superstructure)
- the spotter plane is the preferred consumable choice on all ships except the San Martin, where Radar becomes a viable alternative - the reason for this is the relatively high conceal to radar range difference on Allende and Santander
- as far as consumable usage is concerned, standard rules apply: use your Hydro when you suspect enemy is launching torps at you, and use your Repair when it reaches max capacity, when you are close to dying, or, in case it’s not near max capacity, if you are under very intense fire"
Yurra,Battleship guides,"Common BB guide
- in the early game, sneak up to support a cap and make sure your detection range does not exceed the enemy's side of the nearest cap, then turn out and assume a kiting stance
- you can take potshots in the meantime if you see an opportunity to punish a broadside, but be sure to conceal yourself before you turn out so you don't get punished yourself
- alternate between reverse and 1/2 forward speed while keeping yourself well angled towards enemy BBs (make sure you're heavily angled but can fire all turrets on your target) and provide fire support
- if you start attracting too much focus (3+ ships shooting you) or if the enemy starts to push, start running and try to get somebody else to take over some of the focus fire
- don't blow your DCP on the first fire that gets set on you unless you are at minimum risk of catching another fire (as in somebody just took a potshot at you with HE without really focusing you)
- tank the first fires with your heal, then pull back a bit so you can disengage (when you blow a DCP on fires your detection range drops back to its minimum state, but make sure the detection debuff after firing isn't in place)
- rinse and repeat
- in the mid and late game, look to either assume aggressive positioning on your flank if you have the numerical and/or HP advantage, or kite away and look to apply pressure elsewhere if needed
- for maximum game impact, your target priority should be DDs > broadside cruisers > cruisers you can overmatch > broadside BBs; do note that you should not pull shots at DDs at distances further than 14-15 km, or past whichever range you feel comfortable shooting them at
- your optimal engagement range differs depending on which BB branch you’re playing - for USN, FR and RN BBs, it’s usually 13-18 km, a bit further away for IJN BBs, and a bit closer for Italian, Soviet and German BBs
- if you have nothing to shoot, you can try using your spotter plane and taking potshots across the map into broadsides of enemy ships on the opposite flank (aka crossfire)
- use HE only when you're guaranteed to be shooting a DD with your next volley, or if there is a stubbornly bow-in BB that you can't overmatch, with nothing else to shoot (don't swap to HE from fully loaded guns, just fire the loaded AP into the enemy BB's superstructure instead)
- this guide applies to most BB branches, with each of the specific branches’ peculiarities covered below
USN slow BB specifics (Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Vermont)
- all of the above +:
- look to position around the wider map centre - this will compensate for your low speed and allow you to prevent being outrun or overrun by the enemy
- don’t bother swapping to HE because your reload is god awfully long which means an optimal target for AP might show up by the time you load HE
- with Kansas, Minnesota and Vermont, it may be beneficial to stagger your volleys (hold half your shots for about half your reload time) when shooting at angled cruisers because it forces them to keep their angle in fear of getting smashed for a lot of damage, in case they want to turn and show their broadside
- keep in mind the excellent concealment and rapid Repair cooldown of these ships - it allows you to position closer to the enemy and dictate engagements against enemy BBs and some large cruisers

Ohio and Massachusetts specifics
- these ships play differently from most other USN BBs because they have rapid cooldown repairs and decent secondary armament
- like most other BBs, you should start off by playing them at range, but you should aim to use islands to close the distance with the enemy later on in the game
- look for 1v1 fights against enemy BBs, you will win most of them handily because of your rapid repairs and additional fires set by your secondaries
- if you have the CQC skill on your captain (which you should), you can activate it by having enemy ships within your secondary range but out of your line of sight (aka putting an island between yourself and them) to buff your main battery reload and shoot at far away targets
Georgia
- despite having similarly strong secondaries and rapid repair like Ohio and Massachusetts, Georgia should not play around brawling due to her guns simply being way too good at long range, and her being relatively less survivable than Ohio or Massa
- you should get into secondary range opportunistically, in mid to end-game situations where you can isolate enemy BBs in 1v1 fights
Illinois 
- this BB is very specific because she has cruiser-calibre guns, which means she can’t overmatch anything and is not a threat to broadsides at long range like most other BBs
- her small HP pool, BB-grade detection range and floaty shell ballistics make her optimal engagement range band quite narrow, about 13-16 km - however, you should, of course, attempt to engage targets further than that if you are confident in your aim, or if you are shooting at BBs
- if you can, let other tougher BBs take the punishment while you dish out damage
- she inherits the USN CA improved ricochet angles, so use her AP quite liberally; other than that, her ammo selection follows the standard rules for USN CAs (and most other CAs)
- when playing this ship, you should also consider her floaty ballistics as an advantage - you can use islands to your advantage more liberally than with any other BB
- overall, in order to have a similar impact as most of your peers, you should be doing much more damage than with other T9 BBs because, again, you’re not a long range threat
Hybrid USN BB specifics 
- these ships ideally want to play at 15-18 km away from the enemy in the early game because they take lots of damage to their enormous flight deck hitboxes
- their ballistics are subpar by BB standards, so you also want to be at that distance because it allows you to launch planes without losing too much (if any) gun DPM 
- use planes against enemies that are within 16-ish km, either right after you've fired a volley so you can fire the next one immediately after you get your plane payload off, or, if you want to shoot an enemy DD, have your guns loaded or close to loaded before you launch planes so that you can promptly shoot the enemy as you initiate the attack animation
- don't use planes if you are under a lot of pressure and have to constantly manoeuvre and evade - if necessary, you can manoeuvre to a certain degree using the autopilot, but as well know the autopilot is very wonky and unreliable 
- in case of Kearsarge, you have to skip the animation and miss the DD deliberately because the planes can’t spot and strike the enemy DD at the same time (unless spotted by other means)
- make sure to always double click when you fire your payload so that you immediately skip the attack animation and reassume control of your ship
- don’t push with these ships because, again, they take lots of damage, and instead let tougher friendly BBs take the beating for you - your job is fire and air support
IJN BB specifics
- your role in battle is medium to long range tanking and fire support (with the exception of Fuso which is more suited for medium range)
- your optimal engagement range is a bit higher than that of other BBs due to your distinct accuracy advantage at range (15 km+)
- IJN BB HE is trash unless you’re playing Fuso and Hyuga, so stick to AP
- never try to brawl with Yamato, Musashi, Shikishima and Satsuma because their octagon-shaped citadel makes them extra vulnerable at ranges of less than 10 km, at their maximum possible turret firing angles
- Satsuma-specific:
be careful when using your Combat instructions ability, shoot at targets that are stationary or moving very predictably in order to avoid wasting the ability
IJN BC specifics
- these ships have relatively small HP pools, poor armour plating and poor citadel protection, which means your role is mostly medium and long range fire support
- thanks to their good concealment, in the early game you can sneak up fairly close to the enemy, turn to kite, engage and move away quickly
- their optimal engagement range is 13-19 km, due to their good concealment and good accuracy
- their spotter improves their accuracy - use it when you have a punish opportunity or on an otherwise easy target in order to get maximum damage output out of it
FR BB specifics
- they're squishier than the average BB, so you don't want to be in the centre of attention - their role in battle is medium range fire support 
- Republique has fast reload and good HE, so you want to spam it at bow in BBs when you have no cruisers to click with AP 
- use engine boost while engaging, accelerate and decelerate a lot to reduce incoming damage 
- don't be fooled by the all-forward turret layout of the Richelieu, kiting is the best engagement stance regardless
- your optimal engagement range is 13-18 km for most of these ships, and 15-20 km for Republique and Patrie due to their main battery characteristics and large size
Champagne
- use your engine boost to take early game positions on flanks, or ones that put you into crossfire angles
- like with tech tree FR BBs, use your engine boost's improved acceleration for dodging enemy BB fire
- do not be the one tanking, your armour is exceptionally weak and your HP pool is relatively small, you may find your HP evaporating very quickly if you're not careful
- pay extra attention to the minimap, and always look for opportunities to punish broadsides; if there are no broadsides to punish, resort to overmatching enemy cruisers

RN BB specifics (Conqueror branch)
- their role in battle is medium range fire support with a bit of tanking 
- their HE is really good and you can use it liberally against enemy BBs and battlecruisers, but good ammo selection will still yield superior performance (AP to punish broadsides, overmatch cruisers or, in the case of QE and Nelson, T6 and 7 BBs with 26 mm plating)
- beware not to show your side to enemy BBs because their citadels are quite vulnerable, and don't take too much of the enemy's attention because their plating is vulnerable to HE
RN BCs (St. Vincent branch), Incomparable and Repulse
- their role in battle is medium range fire support and flanking 
- you should avoid tanking because your extremity armour is very vulnerable to overmatch by most BBs in your MM spread, and your HP is low; Duncan and St. Vincent can be a bit more liberal with tanking due to their super Repairs
- use your superior speed and acceleration properties to assume superior positions on the enemy’s sides and avoid taking as many hits as you would with other BBs
- unlike with the main branch RN BBs, your guns have strong AP which should be your dominant ammo type, and only swap to HE if you’re shooting DDs or stubbornly angled high tier BBs
- your optimal engagement range is 13-18 km
- you may struggle with the low tiers due to their lack of range and high top speed, which will require you to have your target deep within your range, as well as to pay close attention to your speed and positioning 
- don't play around using your torpedoes unless you can use islands to close the distance and finish an enemy of; or use them while kiting against ships pushing towards you, if you're close enough and if you have the firing angles
- use the engine boost when you’re in combat in order to further improve your acceleration and the ability to dodge incoming fire, or in the early game if you think it will allow you to assume a superior position on the enemy's side
- on BCs sporting a super Repair, use the first and second charges as late as possible (aka close to the maximum potential healable HP) in order to get the most out of your Adrenaline Rush skill (provided you have it specced, which you should)
- specifically for Incomparable: 
use your hydro if there’s a high risk of torps coming your way
use your spotter plane if you don’t have enough range to hit enemy ships, but make sure you close the distance so you can continue firing after your spotter runs out
IT BB specifics
- their role in battle is medium range tanking and fire support 
- use SAP against most targets except ones you're guaranteed to citadel (broadside BBs at close enough range, broadside cruisers at any range), and except BBs with heavy upper broadside armour (such as high tier German and Soviet BBs)
- use your smoke to disengage, traverse dangerous gaps or turn around when you need to get out of a bad situation, but make sure not to fire from within your smoke because you will get spotted and render it useless
- your optimal engagement range is 12-17 km 

KM BB specifics (tank build)
- their role in battle is medium and close range tanking 
- forget about your HE shells as their damage and fire chance are extremely low - your AP will do more damage if you hit the enemy’s superstructure
- use hydro when enemy DDs are sneaking about and you’re expecting to get torpedoed
- your optimal engagement range is about 13-18 km
- Hannover-specific:
learn your secondary range with the Combat instructions active and use the ability when you can guarantee an enemy to be within that range for most of or all of its duration
KM BB guide (secondary build)
Ignore this guide if you’re not using a secondary-specced KM BB. See above for tank build KM BB specifics.

- play around providing mid range fire support early game, like you would with any other BB - your close range power (secondaries or CQC proc) will come into play later on, when you snowball a flank or when the enemy wants to push, you can use it both offensively and defensively
- make sure you always start engaging in a kiting stance, like with any other BB, which means you are angled away from the enemy, alternating between reverse and 1/2 forward speed while keeping yourself well angled towards enemy BBs (make sure you're heavily angled but can fire all turrets on your target)
- if you start attracting too much focus (3+ ppl shooting you) or if the enemy starts to push, start running and try to get somebody else to take over some of the focus fire
- don't blow your DCP on the first fire that gets set on you unless you are at minimum risk of catching another fire (as in somebody just took a potshot at you with HE with no real focus)
- tank the first fires with your heal, then pull back a bit so you can disengage (when you blow a DCP on fires your detection range drops back to its minimum state, make sure you the detection debuff after firing isn't in place); rinse and repeat
- your target priority should be DDs>broadside cruisers>cruisers you overmatch>broadside BBs
- a neat trick you can pull off on somebody that is eager to push into you is to abuse an island to get into secondary range, turn out and assume a kiting stance safely, and then wait for an overly eager enemy ship to walk into your trap
- make sure you mount the secondary flag in order to max out on secondary range
- when pushing, use islands if you can to get into secondary range and to limit angles of engagement so that you can be shot by as few ships as possible; always mind who can shoot you and beware not to push into a crossfire; when playing FdG and GK, be extra mindful of your angling because you can't bring your back turrets to a firing solution without overexposing your broadside armour

KM BC specifics 
- their playstyle in the early game is more similar to that of cruisers - take potshots at broadsides from long range, avoid tanking damage and try to avoid being focused until you’re making a play because these BCs aren’t as tanky as their proper BB counterparts 
- be extra careful with your DCP usage as you have limited charges
- your secondaries are very powerful when built properly, so much so that you can win any 1v1 fight as long as you have a reasonable amount of HP
- your torps are long ranged, so fling them at any enemies in range or pushing enemies when you have the chance (if you’re not about to push, that is - in that case, save them for drive-by manoeuvres against ships that are not equipped with torps)
VMF BB guide
- early-game you need to be a bit passive until the enemy positions are known, the best way to do this is to take assume kiting stance by turning away before an enemy DD can permanently spot you (usually you don't let your detection range exceed the middle of the nearest cap) and alternating between reverse and 1/2 speed while putting rounds down range, punishing broadsides and overmatching enemy cruisers - in essence, be the team's anchor but don't risk your life for it
- depending on how the game develops, you will either be pushed back and forced to kite, or an opening will pop up for you to exploit
- Soviet BBs work best when they have an island that is reasonably close to the enemy that they can use to limit their engagement angle, but you have to beware who you're going to face before you commit to a play - if there's a DD that can torp rush you from behind an island corner, don't commit; don't expose yourself to a German or USN premium BB inside his secondary range, and instead try to engage him from a distance of 12-15 km in order to negate his secondary battery advantage; also don't commit when there's an enemy CV that can nuke you out of the water for free, rather stick with your team and play the anchor position; always make sure that you don't die for free - take at least 1 enemy ship with you, and enable your team to win the flank by pushing them back or baiting them into overextending to kill you
- and of course don't give your side to enemy BBs because you'll be punished dearly for it (VMF BBs have exposed and vulnerable citadels, except for Kremlin and Ushakov which have very good citadel protection; you should exercise caution nonetheless)
- specific to Ushakov: her Combat Instructions grant her improved accuracy and range, and you should use them when you have an opportunity to heavily punish a broadside target or secure a kill on a nearby enemy DD 
"
Yurra,Aircraft carrier guides,"CV tips
- HE rockets 
meant primarily for attacking DDs but also for when you need quick guaranteed damage on a low HP enemy ship
make sure to attack the enemy from the side in order to maximise your amount of hits
make sure you also learn the rocket firing delay for each CV you’re playing and take appropriate lead - different HE rockets have different delay times before they fire (ranging from 3 to 6 seconds) 
- HE DBs can be used against any ship type, but are more effective against cruisers and BBs
- TBs
very straightforward, you use them against BBs and cruisers and you drop them from the side with appropriate lead, as close to the enemy ship as possible (indicated by the transition to the opaque green zone on your reticule)
don't bother dropping DDs because they will dodge unless they're very bad players
when attacking with TBs, make sure you use their heal when one of your planes turns red or as you’re about to eat a flak cloud by accident
- skip bombers
found on Max Immelmann, Soviet CVs and Béarn
use them to strike cruisers and BBs, or to strike DDs that are spotted and under pressure
aim to line up the final skip line on the reticle with your target's deck, 1 ship length ahead of them if they're going full speed, and make sure you're boosting in order to maximise the distance you drop the bombs from and minimise exposure to AA
- AP DBs 
they excel at nuking enemy cruisers and BBs 
make sure you drop them longitudinally, preferably when your target is in a crossfire and is forced to stay angled
when dropping cruisers, drop from a lower altitude in order to maximise your chances of hitting the target and their citadel (and to avoid overpenetrating the citadel)
when dropping BBs, drop from a higher altitude - your bombs need to drop down almost vertically if you are to penetrate some BBs' citadels
don't maneuver sideways when dropping your bombs because your reticle will struggle to shrink and you will haven inaccurate drop - instead, you need to predict where your target will be in a few seconds, as in you need to line your white reticle up with the position you expect the enemy to be in when you are fully aimed and ready to drop, and only make minimal aim adjustments in order not to fuck your accuracy
- AP rockets
found on German CVs and Aquila
they excel at nuking cruisers, especially ones that are forced into an angle by crossfire or an island, or ones that you catch mid-turn
you can also use them against BBs and DDs if your other planes are depleted
make sure you launch them into the enemy's broadside near the waterline in order to maximise the chances of hitting their citadel

- make sure you drop one or two payloads before going into heavy AA because that way you will prevent unnecessary plane losses and preserve planes for late game
how many pre-drops you do with each squad depends on what kind of AA you're going to strike, and how tough your planes are 
for example, if I'm going for a single ship with my Haku, I will not pre-drop my DBs or TBs because they're tough enough to endure the AA and get all possible strikes on target, but if I'm going against blobs, I pre-drop until 2 DB drops are left and until 4 (or less) TB drops are left
if I'm going against blobs of 4+ heavy AA ships, I don't bother with DBs and leave only 2 drops on my TB squad or look for better targets)
this is something you have to learn by experience for every CV you play and it also depends how adept you are at dodging flak, or how fast you speed through AA
- if there's 3 or 4 DDs on the enemy team, you can start off with HE rockets and try to bully an enemy DD away from a cap zone; otherwise, start off with whichever plane type you feel will be most useful for the first strike and initial spotting (usually DBs for USN and RN CVs, TBs for IJN CVs and German CVs, SBs for Soviet CVs)
- don't use fighters for their presumed role (aka taking down enemy planes) because they are pretty bad at it, the fighters will only tag enemy planes if they are within their actio zone for long enough - do not go out of your way just to protect a teammate with fighters, rather focus on dropping fighters as spotting beacons and dealing damage to enemy ships unless the game depends on you deterring enemy planes from a teammate (you should keep 1 fighter on each of your squadrons for such end game situations) 
- try to avoid the flak explosions (they spawn regularly, every 2 seconds, per ship firing AA at you) by regularly altering your plane speed and course in order to throw them off
- you can dodge flak with TBs by diving under it when you approach the target at 3.5-4 km by initiating the attack run
- make sure you have at least half your engine boost charge for your attack run (IJN and KM CVs can get away even with ⅓ of their boost gauge) so that you can use it to dodge flak and get through AA as quickly as possible
- pay attention to which ships are low HP (securing kills is what CVs are best at) and which ships have used DCP recently; going for the same target over and over again helps stack damage from fires and floods
- when positioning your CV, pay attention to the general distribution of friendly ships and try to keep behind the centre mass of your team
- only go for aggressive island positions close to the enemy when you are absolutely certain you can’t get farmed over the island and when you’re absolutely certain that your team will get the upper hand
- don’t reverse at the start - if you want to move, move forward a tiny bit or move sideways into a covered position closer to the enemy

The most important skills to master first are flak dodging and reserve management, then target priority. Go for isolated targets and targets that are easily killable, and don't go out of your way to hunt enemy DDs unless there's a lot of them and/or they're causing problems for your team.

VMF CV specifics
- use rockets vs BBs and larger cruisers, they can nuke them for large amounts of HP if you get the lead correctly
- use your skip bombers against cruisers and BBs, they're your best plane type (make sure to engine boost while dropping in order to increase the maximum possible drop distance, and aim about 1 ship length ahead); you can also use them against DDs that have already been spotted and are forced into a course by gunfire (try to hit them with the 2nd or 3rd reticle while slowing your planes down)
- use TBs vs BBs, you can drop them both from sideways on and bow on 
- Chkalov-specific: use DBs vs DDs and nothing else, they’re too weak to drop from inside any cruiser or BB AA
- in the mid game, look for safe positions closer to the enemy so you can greatly reduce your plane cycle time thanks to the rocket assisted takeoff mechanic

Essex branch specifics
- you will usually want to rotate between your tactical squadrons and TBs depending on the ship type you’re targeting - the TBs are your most powerful squadron but they’re also limited, so you want to save them for high value targets; once you’re starting to run low on TB reserves, resort to bombers or rockets while your TBs recharge
- their fighters have a vision range of 3 km, which means they’re useless for spotting enemy fleets - only use them for spotting enemy DDs
- their fighters also have faster lock-on times, which makes them much better at defending allies and intercepting enemy squadrons; you should still not go out of your way to drop a fighter over a friendly across half the map, but think a bit more about who you could defend, and pay attention to enemy squadron movement so you can try and intercept them
- your tactical squadrons have smokes, which can be extremely strong when coordinating with div mates; you can also use these smokes to hide yourself and escape when you get spotted"
Yurra,Sub guides,"Submarines' role in battle is that of an ambush assassin, as well as hunting enemy submarines when the situation demands it. 
You want to be on the surface when you're not at risk of being detected in order to avoid depleting your battery, and you want to dive to periscope depth when you are at risk of being spotted. If you are looking for, or fighting enemy submarines, or have to dive to avoid being detected by surface ships, planes or hydroacoustics, dive to maximum depth. Note that anti-sub and anti-surface hydrophone can both spot you at periscope depth. Do keep in mind that hydro will still spot you if you’re at 2 km or less from the ship using it, at any depth.

You should always be thinking about if you can “shotgun” an enemy ship. “Shotgunning” is using torps at close range against ships that are either stationary or moving towards you. Approach them from periscope depth and try to launch your torps close to the 3 km mark. Unguided torpedoes do only 10% of their listed damage within 2.9 km of being fired - considering the sizes of ships in-game and the fact that the in-game listed distances between ships are calculated from their middle point, you have to launch your torps from a bit further away - 3 km of listed in-game distance usually does the trick. It gets trickier if you’re firing at ships moving towards you and it depends a lot on their speed and heading. If you’ve acquired an enemy at close range, don't ping the enemy with sonar because it will tell them where you're coming from which will give them a chance to prepare. Don't use shotgunning against tightly packed blobs of ships, and keep in mind that you will certainly take some damage from follow-up airstrikes if you get spotted. You should usually not attempt to use unguided torps against targets at range because you will almost certainly miss. This is a good idea only when: the enemy is being very predictable and you are almost certain that your torps will catch them; you are at very low HP and do not want to risk the enemy sending ASW airstrikes your way; you are playing the I-56 or the Gato.
You can also use unguided torps against targets that are moving away, but you have to aim the torps slightly short of the lead indicator because you have to assume the enemy will turn away to dodge. Aim at where the enemy’s stern would be relative to the lead indicator.
When shotgunning a DD, you should make sure that you kill them on the first pass so that you don’t get depth charged. Considering the damage reduction below 3 km, killing DDs with shotgunning can be pretty difficult.
You can also “shotgun” using homing torps at close range from a 30 m depth. Approach the enemy at the shallowest max depth setting, almost dive to periscope depth, have the enemy pinged beforehand (your torps will immediately go on an ascending course) and unload torps some 1.5-2 km away from the target. If you don’t want to thread the line between periscope and max depth, you should be at least some 3 km away. This requires the target to be spotted by your teammates. The game will warn you whether your torpedoes can ascend in time to hit your target.


Use homing torps against enemies that are far away or moving away from you. Don't be hasty while launching homing torps - enemy ships can eliminate the ping by using DCP when they spot torps and completely avoid them by changing course if they're properly angled. To counteract this, and assuming you’re at close range, ping the enemy and launch only half of your torpedoes, then stagger the launch of the remaining torps by about half a minute. Sometimes you can also launch all your torps in several directions and apply homing after waiting a bit in order to have the torpedoes come at the enemy from different directions, making them harder to evade. In case you’re far away from your target, you should just dump all your torpedoes at them - by the time they reach the target and the target uses DCP you will probably have a fresh set reloaded.
Don’t ping more than absolutely necessary, and move sideways at max speed in relation to the enemy in order to maximise your chances of avoiding airstrikes. Also change your heading often, if you can. Double pings are usually not necessary and you should only aim to apply double pings against targets that used DCP and when the first ping has been sticking for a while (the timing depends on how reliably you can hit your pings).
You can abuse the homing mechanic to bait the enemy into angling against your ping direction while your torps come in from the side. Keep in mind that using torps like this reduces their range (torpedoes mechanically travel for a set amount of time, not a set amount of distance from the launch point!) because of the longer distance they have to traverse when turning, so beware when doing that near the maximum of their range.
Exercise caution when using homing torps against blobs of enemy ships as your sonar ping effects will reveal your approximate position and attract ASW airstrikes.
You can also do underwater shotgunning. Approach the enemy at the shallowest max depth setting, almost dive to periscope depth, have the enemy pinged beforehand so your torps can start ascending ASAP and unload torps from an appropriate distance from the target. This requires the target to be spotted by your teammates.
You can also launch torps at multiple targets by pinging one target, launching a few torps at them, clearing the target lock for subsequently launched torpedoes (G key by default), and then pinging another target and launching some more torps at them. The torps that are homing in on the first target will remain on their target course, but you shouldn’t forget to refresh the ping if it’s about to expire. Keep in mind that trying to hit multiple targets will require you to ping more, thus attracting more attention and ASW strikes to you. Only use this when you’re trying to burn the DCP of multiple targets.
When pinging, move sideways and change course often in order to avoid ASW planes dropped by enemies guesstimating your position based on your sonar ping visual effect, and, in case they hit you, by the oil spill effects they caused.

As far as deck guns are concerned, don’t ever think about using them unless you have an opportunity to finish off a very low HP target at close range, in situations when their allies can’t follow up with airstrikes or gunfire.

When you’re spotted, start manoeuvring and look out for enemy ASW planes. Keep track of the last inbound plane and use DCP only as their depth charges are about to detonate in order to avoid a full duration flood and oil spills that will give your position away. German submarines are especially unforgiving in this regard as their DCP only lasts for 5 seconds, as opposed to the 15 second duration commonly found on other submarines. Also, be very careful and try not to get spotted often because your DCP charges are limited and you will want to use them sparsely.

Whenever you take damage, an oil spill will appear if you’re underwater. Oil spills appear on the surface and give your exact position away to the enemy, in intervals. They can be cleared by using DCP, or by surfacing.

If you’re having trouble navigating underwater due to low visibility, press the horn keybind (N by default) in order to send out a sonar visual that will mark underwater terrain.

Early game, the first thing you should do is switch flanks in order to avoid having to fight the enemy submarine that will spawn opposite your spawn position. Look to pick off stragglers and try to assist friendly DDs by torping what they spot. Look to play closer to the map centre because submarines are quite slow and the enemy may outrun you or run you over if you are positioned poorly. You can avoid enemy DDs (and subs, in case they’re surfaced or at periscope depth) by diving to periscope depth and using your Hydrophone in order to mark their positions (this will not work if you are fully surfaced!). Avoid fighting enemy subs because it will tell the enemy where you are, thus eliminating your element of surprise, and induce follow-up airstrikes on you. If your submarine has excellent dive time, like the Germans, you can even dive below the enemy at max depth and slip past them completely undetected, and you can then shotgun an unsuspecting enemy from the back. Don’t try blind-pinging enemy DDs heading for caps. Even though it may inconvenience them when your torps reach them, as well as marking their position on the minimap and revealing which particular DD it is, it also lets the enemy know there’s a submarine in the vicinity and, in case an enemy equipped with airstrikes is in range, it may attract unwanted airstrikes. 
	In order to avoid being ambushed by enemy DDs, you can use the Hydrophone. Its detection range is usually long enough for you to pre-emptively use it when expecting an enemy DD to close in on a cap zone, enabling you to avoid being spotted by them in a timely manner.
Mid and late game, look to secure kills and grab unguarded caps. You should look to deal damage by shotgunning enemy ships with unguided torps from point blank range, or torping them with homing torps from outside of your detection range if they're kiting. Always prioritise shotgunning for maximum impact. Shotgunning is particularly risky vs DDs because of their high agility and the torpedo damage reduction below 3 km, which makes it easy to mess up the launch. Don't try to shotgun-torp DDs that are moving away because they may also heavily damage you with DCs if you follow them. When playing USN subs, this tactic is particularly risky because you may run out of battery very quickly as they don't have the battery consumable like the Germans do, but in turn you will be able to deal more damage in a single pass because USN subs have more torps with higher damage.

Positioning-wise, you want to be close to the map centre and avoid island-heavy areas because you (obviously) can't lob torps over islands. Try to isolate and shotgun lone enemy ships if you can, otherwise torp them with homing torps from a distance.

Sub v sub encounters are relatively quick and usually result in one of the subs dying. In order to ensure a hit on an enemy sub, launch your torpedoes at least their DCP duration’s worth of time apart (15 seconds; 5 seconds in case of German tech tree subs) in order to avoid the enemy sub mitigating your entire salvo at once. If you want to avoid homing torps as a submarine, you need to use DCP and change your heading - if you are diving or ascending, stop, and vice versa. If DCP is unavailable, move at full speed angled at some 15-20° to the enemy's torps and turn hard in the opposite direction when the torps are some 300 m away from you in order to maximise the chances of them whiffing past you. In general, try to avoid fighting enemy subs in the early and mid game because it will force you to go underwater, drain your battery which means you may not have enough left for the late game, and attract unwanted ASW. Lingering at periscope depth is the best way to avoid having to fight enemy subs, but it’s not something you should usually do because of battery drain.
Dealing with CVs is very tedious. Subs have no AA which means they have to dive to max depth in order to avoid air spotting, and they also have to wait a whole minute between the first time they ping an enemy CV and the next opportunity to lock torps onto them because CV DCP is dumb and lasts for 60 s. The best way to deal with this is to ping the CV as soon as you spot them in order to force their auto DCP, and then launch your torps at them after some 30 s so you can lock onto the CV when the torps close in on them. Also make sure that you stay outside the CV's auto-ASW range because it will utterly destroy you if you keep pinging from within its range.

Depth management is also quite important. 
Surface: highest detection, you spot enemies at their surface detection range, you can be detected by radar and hydro, hydrophone takes bearing on you. Linger at the surface if you are not in danger of being spotted.

When you pass to periscope depth, your detection will gradually decrease.

Periscope depth: minimum detection range, you spot enemies at their air detection range, you can be spotted by hydro at full range, hydrophone takes bearing on you. This is the best depth to avoid being spotted by ships.

Max depth: you can't be spotted by anything other than anti-sub hydrophone, or hydroacoustics at 2 km or less from the enemy using it. This is the depth where you fight subs and avoid most methods of spotting.

Consumable usage:
DCP: wait for the enemy to unload all their ASW onto you, then use DCP to clear any DoT, disabled modules and oil spills.

Hydrophone: use it preemptively when you suspect an enemy DD is heading for the same cap zone that you are (or whenever you suspect an enemy DD might be close by). Also use it when diving and you suspect an enemy might be right on top of you, in order to avoid being detected and ASW’d.

Sub surveillance: use it when trying to fight enemy subs (duh). You can also use it while you’re on the surface in order to inconvenience an enemy sub and spot them for your team. This is especially useful when the enemy sub is in close proximity to your allies, and, as such, they can’t surface for obvious reasons.

Other consumables are covered in branch-specific guides below.
USN subs
you should look to deal damage from a distance because your battery capacity is low and your torps reload 2 by 2 per group
when attacking enemy ships with homing torpedoes or from a distance, you can first use your bow launchers, then turn tails to the enemy in order to use the stern ones and thus maximise DPM
when shotgunning, you can shotgun the enemy with your bow launchers, dive below them and emerge on the other side and shotgun them again with your aft launchers, but you have to do it with a lot of battery charge in order to avoid getting stuck in the enemy backline and getting obliterated by ASW
use your dive consumable when you need to crash-dive to avoid enemy fire or to improve your manoeuvrability when you are fighting enemy subs
Gato
her gameplay consists mostly of running around at periscope depth and using her unguided torps at short range
if you have to chase, don’t be afraid of trying to hit enemy ships at long range with your unguided torps, they reload very quickly for the damage that they do
only use homing torps if you are forced to fight a highly manoeuvrable target at close range
unlike the tech tree subs, you want to do hit-and-run attacks at periscope depth instead of shotgunning by diving under the enemy because of your high surface and periscope speed and low underwater speed
use your dive consumable when you need to crash-dive to avoid enemy fire or to improve your manoeuvrability when you are fighting enemy subs
German subs
they're better suited for close range combat due to their good detection range and very high battery longevity
the best strategy with these subs is to play around shotgunning - your high battery capacity allows you to stay underwater for very long periods of time and throw torps from unexpected angles
when using homing torps, try to predict enemy movement and only lock onto the enemy if the torps look like they’re going to miss; their long range means you can pre-fire them at where you expect the enemy to be, thus increasing your effective DPM
use your reserve battery when you are forced to be underwater for more than 30 seconds (but at the same time, you battery must not be close to full - keep it drained with at least 60 s left to recharge), that way you will conserve battery charge for the late game
you should also not use your reserve battery at lower than 1:30 min capacity, in order to be able to use 2 charges consecutively without having to surface, in case of emergency

U-4501
at the start, dive immediately and head for a flank position that will allow you to torp large enemy ship and avoid DDs at the same time; use your hydrophone before surfacing in order to see if it’s safe to surface, spot and recharge your battery
in general, your playstyle will consist mostly of hit and run attacks
if you’re not shotgunning, you want to keep your enemies at 6-8 km in order to conserve battery charge as much as possible for cases when you have to dive or when you have no other option but to shotgun and run away
you should mostly dumbfire your torps without locking on, and only lock on if they look like they’re going to miss
only perform shotgunning if you have enough battery to go in and out
as with tech tree subs, you should not use your reserve battery at lower than 1:30 min capacity, in order to be able to use 2 charges consecutively without having to surface, in case of emergency

British subs
these subs only have access to homing torpedoes, have very low survivability and are very slow, which makes them well suited only for stalking the enemy from a distance and spamming them with homing torps from various directions
I can’t stress enough how important it is to stay undetected with these subs - as soon as you’re spotted and targeted by ASW of multiple ships, you will either die or lose most of your HP, which will make any further risk taking impossible
their capability of shotgunning is more limited because they, again, don’t have access to conventional torpedoes, because of their low HP and their very low speed, but their long dive time allows them to pull it off to a certain extent
they are quite good at shotgunning DDs due to their homing torpedoes having a very short arming time, but you must do it only in situations where there will be few or no follow-up airstrikes
before you resurface, use your hydrophone to see whether there are enemy ships nearby - be very liberal with making sure you’re safe because, again, your survivability is very poor

I-56
this submarine is very beefy and specialised primarily for spamming conventional torpedoes from range
due to her extremely poor dive time, diving should be used only in circumstances where you have to avoid being detected, and almost always in conjunction with the reserve battery consumable
due to their extremely poor range, only use homing torpedoes at close range, when you have to dive to avoid being detected 
use her main gun only when you need to finish off low HP targets (you can use it more liberally compared to other subs because of her massive HP pool)
if an enemy submarine is nearby, you need to surface or go to periscope depth in order to avoid detection by sub surveillance - you have no access to sub surveillance and are, as such, completely incapable of fighting enemy subs underwater

Yurra,Ship game impact ratings,"This was included upon request of some players. Keep in mind these ratings are purely expert opinions based on my own experience, and discussions with fellow super unicum players. They haven't been proven in practice or by statistical evidence, and are as such not guides. 

Note: ""broken"", by my definition, doesn't imply performance relative to peers, but merely player opinion about how fun it is to interact with a particular ship, and as such ships that are perceived “broken” by some players may not necessarily be imbalanced (having too high or low game impact).
Also note: higher game impact doesn't equal ""better"". I found that ""good/better/best"" depends on every person's individual criteria, so don't take a ship with high game impact as ""good/best"" for granted because it may not apply to you.

THIS LIST IS ONLY FOR SOLO RANDOM BATTLES. Ships can have vastly different strengths when in a division, in ranked battles, clan battles and tournaments, depending on the format, and sometimes on a particular server’s metagame.

Legend: 
- ships rated below 0 should be placed in a lower tier
- ratings 0-3 are in the underpowered range
- ratings 4-6 are nuances in the balanced range
- ratings 7-10 are in the overpowered range
- ships rated above 10 should be placed in a higher tier

Yurra,Recommended ships for each resource,"As this is a frequently asked question, here I will rank my recommendations for each of the Armoury resources. These recommendations are mostly based on these ships’ maximum performance in random battles, but I also take into account ease of use, credit earning potential and ship price (namely Neustrashimy and Black are more expensive due to formerly being steel ships). I do not take “fun” into consideration because that is a subjective feeling and varies from person to person, hence no point in considering it as a variable.

Coal
Kearsarge > Salem > Malta > Tulsa, Marceau, Groningen > Immelmann, Moskva, Brisbane, Azuma, Ägir, Black, Neustrashimy, Sherman, Tromp, Alvaro de Bazan, U-4501 > Großer Kurfürst, Yoshino, Napoli, Khabarovsk, Marco Polo, Carnot > Iwami, Pommern > Hayate, Halford 

I do not recommend Z-44 at all simply because of how weak she is. I also do not recommend any ship below tier 9 as coal is a very highly demanded resource with a very limited gain rate.

Steel
The recommendation priority here is less pronounced than with coal ships as there are quite a few very strong or otherwise “interesting” steel ships, so I have split them into priority categories. Pick your steel ships based on your class and play style preference.

Bourgogne, Incomparable, Ruggiero di Lauria, Ragnar > Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mecklenburg, Stalingrad, Austin, Z-42, Gato > Shikishima, Plymouth, Vallejo

The reason why I put Vallejo so low, despite her having tier 9 premium credit gain, is because her gameplay style isn’t particularly unique, she can’t be characterised as “very strong” and there are credit grinding ships that are far more easily accessible. 

RP
Ohio > Illinois, Druid, Vampire > Sicilia, Colbert, Siegfried, Hector, Van Speijk, Paolo Emilio > Slava, Sevastopol > Gibraltar

Do note that Slava, Sevastopol and Gibraltar are rather poor performers and you might be better off investing your RP into unique/legendary upgrades.

Doubloons
This is a huge category so I will divide this by tier.
