Creating a Battle.net Account for World of Warcraft
To start your journey, go to the official website: World of Warcraft. At the upper right corner of your screen you will see My Account. Clicking this gives you several options, including options to Log In or Create a Free Account. This allows you to create a Battle.net account. Your Battle.net account is shared with all other Blizzard games including Diablo, Overwatch, Starcraft, and Hearthstone. If you already own one of those games, you can use your existing Battle.net account to play World of Warcraft as well.




Create a free account if you don't have one. You will be prompted to create a BattleTag. Your BattleTag works as your account-wide nickname, not to be confused with your World of Warcraft characters' nicknames. This nickname will be your cross-game identity for your account. People on your Friends List will see your BattleTag, not your real name. You can only change your BattleTag once for free. Any additional changes will require payment, so keep that in mind and choose wisely.

Wowhead Beginner Guides,How to Create a Character,"
Getting Started
Since this is your first time playing, you will start on the Character Creation screen. You can dive right in and create a character...but let's back up a bit and talk about some game systems first.
Choosing a Realm
Note: If you are on your own and don't have friends who play, you can skip this section. You might want to skim through it so you know what the deal is, but there is likely no reason for you to need to switch Realms.

World of Warcraft has a concept called Realms for dividing players into population groups. The idea is that if everyone who played WoW was all in the game at once, it would be super crowded, very laggy, and generally difficult to play and have a good time. To solve this issue, Blizzard set up multiple servers so that each person can play the game in an environment where there are other players, but not too many other players. Each Realm is a different server and the players on each Realm can see, interact, and play with each other. If you want to play with someone on a different Realm, you can, but we'll get to that in a minute.

When you Play for the first time, the game automatically picks a Realm for you, and starts you on the Character Creation screen. If you prefer to pick your Realm you can do that by clicking the Back button. At the top right of this new screen you can see which Realm you are on. The Change Realm button is directly below the Realm name. Click that and you can see a list of all available realms in your region. Notice that there are different Realm tabs at the bottom of the window; if you are looking for a particular Realm it might be under a different tab.

  

Notice that there are different types of Realms: Normal, and RP.
Normal: A normal realm without any special rules.
RP: RP stands for Role-playing, those realms are tailored for people interested in role-playing with their characters.
Why might you want to change your Realm? There are two main reasons.
If you want to play with a friend.
If you are primarily interested in Role Playing.
If neither applies to you, don't even worry about it! Move on to Character Creation...

Once you find or decide on a Realm, select it on the list and click Okay to connect to it.

Playing With Friends
If you are starting your adventure with someone else, you should both select the same Realm for the best experience. This way you will be able to see and interact with each other by default.

If you know someone who already plays the game and you would like to play with them, ask them which Realm they are on and make sure that you join that Realm too. Also ask which Faction they play - more on that in a minute.
Creating a Character
Now it is time to create your character! There are three primary choices that you need to make: Faction, Race, and Class. These are important because they dictate how you will interact with the game and with other players. Faction and Race can be changed for a price, but Class is a permanent decision. The only way to change Class is to create a new character.
Faction
This is World of Warcraft and that means that there needs to be a war. For players, there are two factions in this conflict: The Horde, and The Alliance.

Picking your faction is a major choice because players playing in separate factions cannot interact with one another in a peaceful way. This includes both chat and other social activities, including forming groups to complete objectives. If you want to play with friends, make sure you join the faction that they are affiliated with.

The Alliance and the Horde each have different backgrounds and stories, and are divided along racial lines. Which faction you choose will dictate where you play, who you play with, and what Races you can play.

When World of Warcraft first started, The Alliance was what one could describe in RPG terms as the Normal Races, while the Horde was the Monstrous Races. As time has passed, that line has become fuzzier but still serves to give a general idea of what the divisions are.

The Alliance
The Alliance is the Blue Team. They are under the leadership of a king who lives in the City of Stormwind in the zone of Elwynn, on the continent of the Eastern Kingdoms.

The Horde
The Horde is the Red Team. They are governed by a council from the capital of Orgrimmar in the Durotar zone, on the continent of Kalimdor.
Race
Within each faction, you can pick from seven different races, Alliance players can be Humans, Dwarves, Night Elves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgens or Pandarens, while Horde players can be Orcs, Undead, Tauren, Trolls, Blood Elves, Goblins or Pandaren. Each race can only be certain classes, so picking a race will limit which class your character can be.

There are other playable races in the game, but they are unlocked through gameplay and you won't have access to them immediately.
Class
There are twelve different classes in World of Warcraft, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. As a new player you can select any class but Demon Hunter or Death Knight, which both require that you already have a level 10 character before you can play one. You can learn more about each class by hovering over its icon on the character creation screen.




For more details on each class, what they do, and why they may be the class for you, check out our comprehensive guide on the topic: Choosing Your Class: A Beginner's Guide.

For in depth instruction on how to play each class, check out out beginner guides:

Class Leveling Guides
Death Knight	Demon Hunter	Druid	Hunter
Mage	Monk	Paladin	Priest
Rogue	Shaman	Warlock	Warrior

The Character Creation Interface
The Character Creation Interface is very straightforward.
Alliance races are listed on the left.
Horde races are listed on the right.
You can switch gender using the buttons in the middle at the top. The gender of your character doesn't have any influence on what it can or cannot do in the game, it is purely cosmetic. Pick whichever model appeals to your character fantasy the most!
At the bottom of the screen you can see the classes available for you to play for the race that you have selected.


Pick a race, a class, and a gender. When you are ready, click the Customize button.
Customization
There are hundreds of different character customizations to choose from, depending on which race you selected. You can change hair color, fur color, skin color, markings, eye color, accessories, and more.

Click the icons above the selection pickers to see more options. Some races have a lot more options than others.

     
Character Name
On this screen, you must also select your character's name. This name must be unique on the Realm you're playing on, plus there are a few names that cannot be used due to some restrictions. World of Warcraft is an established game with a lot of players so sometimes getting the name you want can be challenging. If your name is taken, don't be discouraged. Try alternative spellings, or make up a name. If you are feeling out of ideas, try the Randomize button, sometimes it can be just what you need to spark a good name idea!

Once you're done, hit Finish and your character will be ready to go.


What Now?
You have:
Learned how to change Realms
Learned what you need to do if you want to play with friends
Chosen your class, race, and Faction
Customized your character
Chosen a unique character name
Created your first character
When you're ready, hit Enter World."
Wowhead Beginner Guides,How to Play World of Warcraft,"Getting Started
When you click Enter World for the first time on a character, you will be treated to a cut-scene, a short movie with a voice-over establishing your place in Azeroth as a member of whatever Faction you chose. The cut-scene will bring the camera to your character and then end with you standing on the deck of a ship.

 


Welcome to the Exile's Reach scenario. This is a short scenario to introduce you to the game mechanics. The Exile's reach scenario does a pretty good job of showing you the basics as you go, and while this guide covers a lot of the same things, we have a little more detail.

First, some basics.
The Camera
The camera is your view of the world, what you can see. In World of Warcraft, the camera is always centered on your character. You can manipulate the Camera in a few useful ways.
You can zoom in or zoom out by using your mouse scroll wheel.
You can look around by holding the Left Mouse Button and moving the Mouse. This will not move your character.
You can change your facing by holding the Right Mouse Button and moving the Mouse around the screen. This will also make your character face that direction.
 

The Action Bar
At the bottom of your screen you will notice a bar flanked by two gryphons. This is your Action Bar. Each square cell will hold a button allowing you to use your Abilities. As you can see in the image below, there are two Abilities currently on the Action Bar. In the top right corner of the occupied cells there is a digit. This digit corresponds to the number bar on your keyboard. To use the Ability, you can either click the button with your mouse, or press the corresponding number key. Empty cells do nothing if you click on them.



There are multiple rows of cells to put buttons in. At first you won't need them all, but the arrows at the right end of the Action Bar allow you to cycle through your Action Bars. If you know you had Abilities on your bar but you don't see them, you may have inadvertently switched Bars. Click the arrows to get back to Action Bar 1.
Moving your Character
To move your character, there are two options: using your keyboard or using your mouse.

Using your keyboard, press W to move forward, S to move backwards, A to turn left, or D to turn right. You can also use the arrow keys to make these same movements.

To jump, use your space bar and strafe (move to the left or right while still facing forwards) using Q and E.

With your Mouse, you can hold both Left and Right Mouse Buttons down to move your character forward. Moving your mouse left or right will allow you to turn. You can't move backwards with your mouse, but you can turn around move a few steps, and turn back around very quickly, which usually serves the same purpose.
Other Characters
You are going to see other characters. Some, like the Quest Giver in front of you are NPCs (Non-Player Characters), characters that aren't controlled by a player but who are part of the world. Others are Players, people like you, playing the game. Usually NPCs have their name in green over their head, while Player names are blue. NPCs tend to stand in place or have a small area that they may walk around. Players tend to be sitting or standing AFK (Away From Keyboard) or running about all over the place. You will get used to figuring out who is which.
Quest Givers
Quests are missions and the main source of experience in World of Warcraft. You will complete plenty of them while playing.

Quest Givers are a type of NPC with which you will become intimately familiar. As the name implies, they give out quests. A Quest Giver has a yellow exclamation point over their head if they have a quest to offer you, or a yellow question mark if you have completed their quest and they are ready to give you your reward. A gray question mark indicates that you have accepted a quest from the Quest Giver, but have not yet completed the requirements to turn it in.

In the Exiles Reach screenshots above, Captain Garrick and Warlord Breka Grimaxe are the Quest Givers who have a quest for you. To interact with a Quest Giver, move to them, mouse over them, and right-click.
Leveling and Experience
All characters have Levels. You start at Level 1. As you complete objectives you will earn Experience. As you earn Experience, you will gain Levels. The maximum Level is Level 60. Your Level defines how strong you are, what content you can enjoy, and how that content reacts to you, as well as how many Abilities, how much Health, and how many Resources you have to take on the content. More Levels = more power, more power = harder content. Once you reach Level 60 you will be ready to take on Endgame content which is some of the most fun, interesting, and rewarding content in the game, as well as the most challenging.

In order to reach the next Level, or to Level Up, you need to fill your Experience Bar. The Experience Bar is just below your Action Bar at the bottom of your screen. Every time you kill an enemy or complete a quest, you gain Experience which fills, even if a just little, that bar. Once the bar fills up completely, your Level is increased by one. You will get more Health, more of whatever Resource your Class uses, and often, a new Ability which you can add to your Action Bar and work into how you play your character. Note that some Abilities are Passive, meaning they grant you a bonus automatically and you don't need to have them on your Action Bar.



For more information about Experience and how to maximize it, check out our detailed guide: Rested Experience

Gameplay
Enough information overload! You are here to play the game. So let's play!
Quests
Check out the Quest Giver, the character in front of you with the yellow exclamation point over their head. Move to them, mouse over them, and right-click. This opens a window in the left side of your screen explaining your quest objectives. You can accept the quest by clicking Accept.



After you have accepted the quest, the window will close and a gray question mark will appear over the head of the Quest Giver. You will also notice that the quest title appears on the right side of your screen along with the objectives. If you need a refresher, you can reread the quest by clicking on its title. This will open the quest window as well as your Map. While you are on the ship, your Map isn't very useful, but it will come in handy later.




There are many different types of quest objectives, but usually quests will require you to go somewhere and do something. If you are having trouble figuring out where to go, you can open your Map, by clicking on your quest, or by pressing M. The the quest objective is in the area highlighted in blue.



Combat
There are two main subgroups of classes in the game: Ranged and Melee. Ranged classes can attack their enemies from a distance, while melee need to get close to their targets. So if you have selected a melee class, you must also get close to your target in order to attack it.

In the Exile's Reach scenario your first quest will ask you to practice on a Combat Dummy. Just move over to the Combat Dummy if you are a melee class (short range) or ""in range"" if you are a ranged class (long range). You will know that you are close enough if you click on the Combat Dummy and then look at your Action Bar. If the digits on your buttons are red, move a little closer. When they turn white, you are in range.

  


You will have a few more training quests to complete while you are on the ship. Once you are off the ship (no spoilers!) things get fun!

Early quests will require you to kill enemies or creatures nearby. You will see their names and bars in yellow or red. That means that they are attackable targets, like the Combat Dummy. Red named enemies or ""mobs"" will attack you if you get to close to them. Yellow named mobs will allow you to strike first. The bar is their health bar; bringing their health to 0 will kill them.

Once you find your target, Left-Click on them or their name or bar to select them, that's called targeting. In the top left corner of your screen, you will see your character portrait, plus health bar and, if you have selected a target, the portrait of your target and their health bar. After targeting your objective, it is time to kill it.

 

Check out your Action Bar. At the start, you should have only one ability on it, which will be a damaging ability. In order to use it, press 1 while with a target selected. Some abilities have something called a cast time, meaning they take a few moments until they are launched and you cannot move while the cast is happening, while others happen instantaneously. When the ability is used with success, it will damage your enemy, which will make it attack you back. Repeat using your ability by pressing 1 whenever possible.

Once your enemy's health reaches 0, it will die. When an enemy dies, you can loot its corpse by getting near it and Right-Clicking it. It will twinkle helpfully to let you know it can be looted. When you loot a corpse, a loot window opens showing you what your victim was carrying. You can Right-Click an item to transfer it to your inventory.
Completing Quests

Once you've finished killing all enemies for your quest, it is time to turn it back to the quest giver. Press M to see where it is on the map. You can also find it easily nearby you by looking for the yellow question mark in its head. Get nearby the quest giver and Right-Click him to open the quest dialog. On the left it will show the dialog for the quest, allowing you to hit Complete Quest to finish it. Every quest you complete will have a reward attached to it, some bonus experience, some items to make your character stronger or some currency to be used with merchants.



Once you finish a quest, it will usually open new quests for you to do, look for new quest markers on NPC after finishing ones. Also, you can have more than one quest at a time, meaning one quest can unlock more than one, so keep an eye for other nearby NPCs with exclamation marks!

When in multiple quests, you can check the objectives of both on your map, by pressing M

Different Quest Objectives

Not all quests will require you just to kill enemies or creatures, some have different objectives. Some quests will require you to loot corpses of enemies to search for some item. When that is the case, make sure to loot every enemy marked for the quest, because otherwise the objectives won't be completed.

Other quests may have their objectives to be actual items in the world. When that happens, you're not required to kill an enemy, just to interact with objects in the world. Those objects will be highlighted with a yellow shade around them. To interact with them, move close enough and press Right-Click on them to loot them.

Equipment

While doing quests, some quests will reward you with a special kind of item, pieces of equipment. Equipments, as the name suggests, are items that your character can wear to become stronger. Every character has 17 different pieces of equipment it can wear, and different items that fit in each of those slots. You can see your current equipped items by opening your character pane, by pressing C.

In order to see which items you currently have, press B to open your bags. Every item that is equippable will have some extra text on its description. It will list which equipment slot that item goes in, which equipment type it is and what are the benefits from equipping it.
Death
As your enemies die when their health reaches 0, so do you. If you let your health reach 0, you will die. When you die you can Recap to see what killed you or Release Spirit to start the process of reviving.

When you release your spirit, you end up in the Spirit World and are invisible to other players. You will be placed by a Spirit Healer. Spirit Healers are NPCs that allow you to return to life if you talk to them, but that will damage all your items, plus reduce your strength by 75% for 10 minutes. To avoid that, you can run in the spirit world to where you perished and reincarnate in your body. In order to do that, press M to see where your body is, it will be marked with a little gravestone icon in the map.


Once you reach your body, a window will pop up asking if you want to resurrect. By clicking Accept, you will return to life where you currently are and you can see where you died by looking for a skeleton in the ground.

Wowhead Beginner Guides,Choosing Your Class: A Beginner's Guide,"Introduction
Choosing your class in World of Warcraft can be one of the most important and time consuming decisions a player ever makes. The purpose of this guide is to assist YOU, my fellow heroes and adventurers, in finding the class in World of Warcraft that YOU will enjoy playing. However, before we get started with finding your class, there are some disclaimers that I would like to make:
Since this is a guide designed to help YOU decide what class will be best for YOU to play, I will do my best to ensure that this guide stays free of bias and only provide the information as it is.
This guide serves purely as a starting point for new or returning players. Advanced game play topics such as min/maxing, rotation, talents, and builds will NOT be covered by this guide.
World of Warcraft is a game that is constantly evolving. I will do my best to update this guide on a regular basis to keep the information as current as possible.
With that information in mind, let's begin!

Getting Started
Before we get started discussing classes in extensive detail, I would like to first go over some basic terminology:

Class:
When you are in the process of creating a new character, one of the first things you will notice (aside from gender, race, and faction selection) is that there are what's called ""Classes"". In World of Warcraft, there are a total of 12 classes to choose from and they are as follows: Death Knight Death Knight, Demon Hunter Demon Hunter, Druid Druid, Hunter Hunter, Mage Mage, Monk Monk, Paladin Paladin, Priest Priest, Rogue Rogue, Shaman Shaman, Warlock Warlock, and Warrior Warrior. Each class provides its own set of unique benefits, abilities, and spells (as you will discover from reading this guide).
Specialization:
Upon reaching level 10, you will be able to select what is called your specialization or spec. Each class in World of Warcraft has its own set of different specs that further diversifies the class by adding unique abilities only that spec can use as well as potentially changing the role that class plays in content. For example: As a Demon Hunter Demon Hunter you have two specs: Havoc and Vengeance. While both specs share abilities that are common to the class such as  Double Jump and  Spectral Sight, both specs have unique abilities that differentiates one spec from another. As a Havoc demon hunter, you have spells like  Blade Dance to deal out more damage, or as a Vengeance demon hunter, you have spells like  Demon Spikes and  Fiery Brand which allows you to take less damage and keep enemies off of your allies.

DPS:
In World of Warcraft, the term DPS refers to one of two things: Damage per second (the amount of damage done per second) or DPS as a role type. DPS are the damage dealers. From a general standpoint, as a DPS it is your goal to do as much damage as possible in as short of a time period as possible. There are two types of DPS roles: Melee and Ranged. As a melee DPS, you get up close and personal with the target to deal damage. However, as a ranged DPS, you deal damage to your enemies from afar.
*Please note: DPS will be primarily referred to as one of the role types of a class/specialization; however, there will be a few points during class analysis (such as Pros and Cons) where DPS will be referred to in the numerical sense.
Healer:
In World of Warcraft, a Healer is a person who uses a variety of powerful magics to heal allies, prevent casualties, and resurrect allies. As a healer, it is your job to keep your allies alive whether it be on the battlefield or in a dungeon/raid.
Tank:
In World of Warcraft, the term Tank refers to a person who protects their allies from harm by absorbing/preventing damage. Additionally, it is the tank's job to keep enemies from damaging the DPS and Healer(s) as little as possible by getting up close and personal with the enemy. In a typical raid composition, MOST raid groups will use 2 tanks for the majority of the encounters they face (with there being a few exceptions depending on the raid and boss fight). However, in dungeons, only 1 tank is required.

Single Target:
Single target refers to the damage or healing you do to ONE target. An example of a single target damage spell is  Frostbolt. An example of a single target healing spell is  Healing Wave.
AoE:
AoE or Area of Effect, refers to the damage or healing you do spread across multiple targets at once. An example of an AoE damage spell is  Rain of Fire. An example of an AoE healing spell is  Essence Font.
Cleave:
Cleave refers to a spell or ability that deals gradual AoE damage when used consecutively. Cleave can also refer to a spell that deals damage to a primary target and additional damage (also called ""splash damage"") to surrounding targets. An example of a spell that cleaves is the very unsurprising Arms warrior spell  Cleave.
HoT:
HoT(s) or Heal Over Time, refers to healing spells that heals one or more targets over the course of several seconds. An example of a HoT spell is  Rejuvenation.
DoT:
DoT(s) or Damage Over Time, refers to a spell that deals damage over the course of several seconds. An example of a DoT is  Unstable Affliction.

Classes
Now that we have the vocabulary out of way, let's learn about the classes! In the tables below, I will provide some brief information and lore about each class, the role types and specs of each class, some sample spells and abilities that are specific to each spec, the pros and cons of each spec, and finally, resources that will be beneficial to furthering your knowledge about the playstyles and lore of each class.

- Damage ramps up over time
- Not good at switching targets because of ramp

Hero Class:
In World of Warcraft, Death Knights (as well as Demon Hunters) are what's known as a hero class meaning that they extra have perks that the other classes don't. For example, as a dk you start at level 8 instead of at level 1 (DK's that are Allied Races start at level 10 instead), you start with a mount specifically for your class, and you even have additional character customization options such as more/different hair color, eye color, and skin color options that are completely unique to your class.
Increased Mount Speed:
Another perk of being a dk is that you passively move 20% faster while mounted through your passive  On a Pale Horse which you get at level 22.
Three Unique Class Mounts:
With the introduction of class mounts in patch 7.2, every class now has its own set of class mounts; however, as a dk you have not just one class mount, but three! While it might sound silly to have three class mounts, I will explain. Prior to Legion patch 7.2, only the two hero classes Death Knights and Demon Hunters as well as warlocks and paladins had class mounts. As a dk, you could acquire  Acherus Deathcharger and Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade. However, when class mounts were introduced in patch 7.2, death knights also received the ability to acquire an additional class mount:  Deathlord's Vilebrood Vanquisher which changes color based on your spec. (Blood is red, Frost is blue and white, and unholy is green).
Acherus and Death Gates:
An additional perk of being a dk is access to what is known as a  Death Gate. A death gate allows you to open a gate from anywhere in the universe and transport yourself back to the dk home base: Acherus: The Ebon Hold. From Acherus (which is a floating Necropolis in the sky) you can then use your death gate again to transport yourself back to where you last were.
Runeforging:
Lastly, one of the biggest perks as a DK is the ability to engrave your weapons with runes that enhance your combat performance in a process called  Runeforging. Runeforging replaces weapon enchants and can be placed on any of your weapons. To access the runeforge, you must go to Acherus, the Ebon Hold (Use your  Death Gate) or Seat of the Primus (Necrolord Players only) and visit a runeforge. Here is a list of possible runeforge enchantments you can place on your weapon in World of Warcraft: Shadowlands:  Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle,  Rune of the Fallen Crusader,  Rune of Razorice,  Rune of Hysteria,  Rune of Sanguination,  Rune of the Apocalypse,  Rune of Unending Thirst.

The quest can be completed once daily in addition to every 10 levels from level 10-59.
Zen Pilgrimage:
Another perk of playing a monk is having the spell  Zen Pilgrimage. While it may not sound very exciting at first,  Zen Pilgrimage can act very similar to a hearthstone without the wait. On the first cast, Zen Pilgrimage takes you to the Peak of Serenity (Unless you complete the Legion intro questline for monks) and using it again teleports you back to where you previously were. If a player decides to level in Legion content, once the introductory Legion quests are completed, their Zen Pilgrimage spell is modified to teleport them to a phased, fully explorable version of The Wandering Isle (Pandaren starter zone) that has portals to the Peak of Serenity and Dalaran."
Choosing Your Class,Paladin,"""We are inherently unworthy, simply because we are human, and all human beings--aye, and elves, and dwarves, and all the other races--are flawed. But the Light loves us anyway. It loves us for what we sometimes can rise to in rare moments. It loves us for what we can do to help others. And it loves us because we can help it share its message by striving daily to be worthy, even though we understand that we cannot ever truly become so.""

Champions of the Light and crusaders of justice, Paladins seek to walk the path of righteousness in all things they do.

Auras:
One form of utility that paladins bring with them is auras. Auras are passive effects that provide a passive benefit to the paladin and their allies. Here are the auras that paladins learn leveling up:  Crusader Aura,  Devotion Aura,  Retribution Aura, and  Concentration Aura.

Blessings and Divine Shield:
Perhaps one the biggest perks of playing a paladin is the wide variety of defensive cd's that you have. All paladins have access to a variety of powerful defensive spells such as  Blessing of Protection,  Lay on Hands, and  Divine Shield (Which is arguably one the strongest if not the strongest defensive cd in the game).
Mount Speed Increase:
Just like DK's, Paladins also receive a passive 20% mount speed increase at level 21 called  Crusader Aura.
Two Unique Class Mounts:
With the introduction of class mounts in patch 7.2, every class now has its own set of class mounts; however, as a pally you have not just one class mount, but two! While it might sound silly to have two class mounts, I will explain. Prior to Legion patch 7.2, only the two hero classes Death Knights and Demon Hunters as well as Warlocks and Paladins had class mounts. As a paladin, you acquire at level 10 your racial mount:
 Summon Exarch's Elekk (Draenei)
 Summon Sunwalker Kodo (Tauren)
 Summon Thalassian Warhorse (Blood Elves)
 Summon Warhorse (Humans)
 Summon Dawnforge Ram (Dwarves)
 Summon Darkforge Ram (Dark Iron Dwarves)
And some races receive a level 20 upgrade:

 Summon Great Sunwalker Kodo (Tauren)
 Summon Thalassian Charger (Blood Elves)
 Summon Charger (Humans)
Additionally, after you complete the Legionfall campaign on the Broken Shore at level 45+, you can acquire an additional class mount called  Highlord's Golden Charger that flies and has 3 other color variations that you can obtain.
Divine Steed Customization:
As a paladin, it always helps that you have your trusty steed wherever you go with  Divine Steed. You can customize your divine steed spell to match your preferences. As a tauren or draenei you can make your  Divine Steed look the human or blood elf horses with Glyph of the Trusted Steed Glyph of the Trusted Steed, or ALL Paladin races have access to Golden Charger's Bridle Golden Charger's Bridle when they unlock their legion class mount as well as Valorous Charger's Bridle Valorous Charger's Bridle (Holy), Vengeful Charger's Bridle Vengeful Charger's Bridle (Ret), and Vigilant Charger's Bridle Vigilant Charger's Bridle (Prot)."

Scions of the Light or master wielders of the Void, priests utilize their holy and void powers to heal allies and destroy enemies. Priests have three specializations: Discipline, Holy, and Shadow. Each of the three specializations utilizes intellect as a primary stat and wears cloth armor.

Priest Weapon Proficiency:
As a priest, you are able to use the following weapons:
- Daggers
- One-Handed Maces

Description:
Discipline Priests or Disc Priests, are a type of Healer specialization that utilizes holy magic to shield allies and sear enemies with holy light as well as shadow magic that both heals allies and damages foes. Disc priests are unique in that they heal allies by dealing damage to enemies aside from their regular healing spells. As a disc priest you are equipped with an arsenal of spells and abilities such as  Power Word: Barrier,  Power Word: Shield,  Pain Suppression, and  Leap of Faith to shield and/or protect allies from harm,  Power Word: Radiance, (Spell #186263), and  Flash Heal to heal your allies, and  Penance,  Shadowfiend, and  Shadow Word: Pain to assail your foes.

Pros:
- Strong burst healing
- Healing can be reactive (Can apply strong healing after damage is taken)
- Can heal for a limited time upon death
Cons:
- Falls behind in healing during high movement encounters
- Limited mobility
- Healing falls off if targets are spread out

Description:
Crazed heretics and masters of shadow and void, shadow priests are a type of DPS specialization that utilizes shadow magic to cause physical and mental anguish to their enemies, the destructive power of the Void to ascend to a new form and destroy enemies, and a special resource called Insanity Insanity. As a shadow priest you encase yourself in shadow energy with  Shadowform and cause severe pain to your enemies by ripping their mind to shreds with  Mind Blast,  Mind Flay, and  Silence, and unleashing devastating shadow magic with  Shadow Word: Pain,  Shadow Word: Death, and  Shadowfiend. Additionally, shadow priests have access to (Spell #186263),  Dispersion, and  Vampiric Embrace to protect themselves from harm and heal allies if the need arises.
Pros:
- Flexible playstyle
- Great sustained damage
- Good utility
Cons:
- Playstyle requires a lot of management
- Damage requires the player to stand still often

Mass Dispel:
As a priest you have access to one of the best utility spells in the game. As the name suggests,  Mass Dispel allows you to dispel a beneficial magical effect off of 5 enemies and a harmful magical effect off 5 allies effectively allowing you to dispel a total of 10 targets in a 15 yard radius. However, there is a drawback to using this ability in succession. Using  Mass Dispel will cost you 8% of your base mana everytime you use it. While this might not seem like a lot, 8% adds up very quickly especially when used during combat in conjunction with other spells.
Mind Control:
Arguably one of the most fun spells to use in the game,  Mind Control allows the priest to temporarily take control of an enemy (this also includes other players) and move them as they see fit. While this spell doesn't have much use in PvE content, this spell is often used in PvP combat to walk enemies off of ledges in battlegrounds (which most of the time kills the enemy player) or creates the potential to isolate and/or pick off a target in arenas. However, you are not completely immune while channeling this ability. You can still be damaged and interrupted by players at any point while channeling this ability.
Mind Soothe:
While it may not seem incredible,  Mind Soothe has some excellent implications in dungeon and raid content. Essentially, this spell can allow for you and your group to skip past packs of mobs that you would otherwise have to kill. This spell is especially helpful in dungeon content such as mythic plus where certain trash packs need to be skipped and your group does not have a rogue to  Sap or a demon hunter to  Imprison.
Levitate:
Lastly, one final perk of being a priest is the ability to  Levitate people. Similar to a mage's  Slow Fall,  Levitate slows a player's fall speed. However, what makes levitate slightly better than  Slow Fall is that levitate also allows the person it's cast on to glide across water. However, the only draw back to this ability is if a player who has levitate takes damage, the spell will break."

Description:

As a sub rogue you are equipped with abilities such as  Shadowstrike,  Symbols of Death , and  Shadow Blades to strike from the shadows and devastate your foes,  Rupture and  Eviscerate to finish off your foes and prevent them from escaping.

-Decent burst damage
Cons:
- Playstyle requires a lot of skill
- Has to choose between AoE or single target damage
- Damage is weak outside of burst

Lockpicking:
One unique perk of being a rogue is the ability to open locked chests and lockboxes with  Pick Lock. While being able to pick locks might not seem like a cool perk, often times, lockboxes and chest contain gold and gear you can sell for more money. Additionally, players often tip rogues for opening lockboxes for them.
Pickpocket:
Another unique rogue perk is the ability to  Pick Pocket NPC's. In World of Warcraft: Legion, pickpocketing can be very profitable and can even be used to purchased unique toys that are available for rogues only. If you're interested learning more about the specifics of pickpocketing as well as all the unique rewards associated with it, you can read Wowhead's Pickpocketing Guide.
Shroud:
Perhaps one of the best forms of utility in the game,  Shroud of Concealment allows the rogue to temporarily stealth other group members. This spell is especially powerful in dungeon content for skipping packs of mobs and even in PvP where shroud can be used to ambush the enemy team.
Stealth:
Lastly, one of the biggest perks of being a rogue is the ability to  Stealth.  Stealth, as the name suggests, allows the player to become invisible to players and MOST NPC's allowing the player to sneak around and grant them access to spells only usable while stealthed such as  Pick Pocket,  Distract, and  Cheap Shot."
Choosing Your Class,Shaman,"""The relationship between the elements and the shaman is one of synchronicity. The shaman's influence helps to calm and unite us, just as our influence enriches and fulfills the shaman.""

Shamans have three specializations: Elemental, Enhancement, and Restoration. Each of the three specs wears mail armor and utilizes Mana Mana as a base resource.

Pros:
- Great sustained damage
- Flexible builds/playstyles
- Adaptable to a variety of damage situations
Cons:
- Limited burst
- Damage is very dependent on talents

Description:

Additionally, enhancement shamans can also summon spirit wolves to fight for them with  Feral Spirit and buff their melee allies with  Windfury Totem.

- Excellent raid utility
- Great group healing
- Good mobility and able to temporarily cast while moving with  Spiritwalker's Grace
Cons:
- Targets need to be grouped up or healing loses value
- Healing outside of cool downs is slow

Astral Recall:
One perk of being a shaman is the ability to have a second Hearthstone Hearthstone with an ability called  Astral Recall. If your Hearthstone Hearthstone is on cooldown and you need to go back to where you hearthed from, you can cast  Astral Recall. This spell is particularly useful because it cuts the amount of time you have to wait to hearth by 20 minutes (5 minutes if you're in a guild because of the Hasty Hearth guild perk). This spell is also extremely useful because it doesn't share a cooldown with your hearthstone, increasing the amount of times you can hearth per hour.
Bloodlust/Heroism:
Another perk of being a shaman is the ability to cast  Bloodlust or  Heroism. What makes this spell special is that it provides a significant damage boost by increasing the haste of every person in your group by 30% for 40 seconds. This ability is highly desired by raid and dungeon groups alike making shamans a class that is often sought after in almost every type of group PvE content.
Ghost Wolf Form:
Starting at level 16, shamans gain access to a spell called  Ghost Wolf which allows the shaman to transform into a ghost wolf that increases their movement speed by 30%. What's notable about this ability is that it functions similar to a druid's  Travel Form. However, while  Travel Form moves faster than  Ghost Wolf,  Ghost Wolf can be used both indoors and outside. Lastly, you can customize ghost wolf form's appearance with glyphs. Glyphs are cosmetic items created by players with Inscription Inscription which allow players to modify the visual effects of certain spells and abilities. As a shaman, these are the glyphs you can use to modify  Ghost Wolf:  Glyph of the Spectral Raptor and  Glyph of the Spectral Wolf.
Hex Customization:
One big perk of being a shaman is the ability to customize your  Hex spell. By default,  Hex turns the target it's cast on into a frog, but by obtaining specific items, you can change what you turn your target into (this ability can also be used on players in PvP combat). The following is a list of the different variations of the Hex spell:  Hex,  Hex, and  Hex.
Reincarnation:
For other classes, death is the end. However, for shamans they have a second chance at life with  Reincarnation. While this ability does have a 30 minute cool down, it can be helpful in raids when progressing on new fights in raids or in non-rated pvp to catch enemies by surprise. This ability also has the added benefit of not requiring your allies to use a battle rez to resurrect you while in combat."
Choosing Your Class,Warlock,"""No longer are they shaman. They were abandoned by the elements - They will call them no longer and beg for their aid. Behold those who have power, and who are not afraid to wield it. Behold... The Warlocks!""
-Gul'dan
Description:
In the face of demonic power, most heroes see only death, whereas Warlocks see opportunity. Warlocks are voracious spellcasters that utilize the powers of shadow and the destructive forces of fel to either slowly drain their enemies' lives, swarm them with a vast army of demons, or strike with chaotic energy. Warlocks have three specializations: Affliction, Demonology and Destruction.

Curses:
Warlocks posess a myriad of curses that can debilitate their foes. Curses are mostly potent in pvp content but also have useful implications in dungeon and raid content. Warlocks have access to the following curses:  Curse of Weakness,  Curse of Exhaustion,  Curse of Tongues
Demons
Warlocks of all specializations have an array of demons at their disposal. A warlock can have 1 demon up at a time, and each of them have different utilities:
 Summon Imp invokes an Imp that casts Firebolts at a distance, and can be used to heal minor wounds and remove bad magic effects from you.
 Summon Voidwalker invokes a Voidwalker that can withstand heavy punishment and tank mobs for you.
 Summon Succubus invokes a Succubus that attacks enemies with her whip, and can seduce them, stopping them in their tracks.
 Summon Felhunter invokes a Felhunter that can interrupt an enemy's spellcast, as well as devour their beneficial magic effects.
 Summon Felguard is exclusive to Demonology Warlocks, and invokes a Felguard that can cleave enemies and stun with its axe.
Healthstones and Soulstones
Warlocks have unique utility in the form of Healthstone Healthstone, an item that can used to heal a percentage of their maximum health. You can trade healthstones with your allies, and even create many of them at the same time, thanks to  Create Soulwell. Warlocks are also one of the few classes in the game with a combat ressurrection in the form of  Soulstone. What makes this unique when compared to a Druid or Death Knight's combat ressurrection, is that you can preemptively use a Soulstone on your ally - If they die while the Soulstone is active, they can simply use it to ressurrect.
Summoning Rituals
Warlocks are also the only class in the game that can summon players, thanks to  Ritual of Summoning. This, in conjunction with 2 other players, allows you to create a summoning portal that can be used to summon other allies to your location.
Three Unique Class Mounts:
With the introduction of class mounts in patch 7.2, every class now has its own set of class mounts; however, as a Warlock you have not just one class mount, but three! While it might sound silly to have three class mounts, I will explain. Prior to Legion patch 7.2, only the two hero classes, Death Knights and Demon Hunters as well as Warlocks and Paladins had class mounts. As a Warlock, you can acquire  Felsteed and  Dreadsteed. However, when class mounts were introduced in patch 7.2, Warlocks also received the ability to acquire an additional class mount:  Netherlord's Chaotic Wrathsteed which changes color based on your specialization. (Affliction is purple, Demonology is a firey red and orange, and Destruction is fel green).
Customizable Fire Spells:
Warlocks have quite a few fire spells, and those originally have the usual fire colors and effects. However, seasoned Warlocks can pursue an epic questline to obtain  The Codex of Xerrath, a spell that corrupts all your Fire spells (as well as your  Felsteed and  Dreadsteed!) and turns them into green, fel fire!"
Choosing Your Class,Warrior,"""Remember: Life is nothing without valor""
-Odyn
Weapon masters, bloodthirsty berserkers, and defenders of the weak, warriors are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. With their raw strength, determination, and pure hatred, warriors seek to vanquish any foe who stands in their way. Warriors have three specs: Arms, Fury, and Protection. All three warrior specs utilize strength as their primary stat, wear plate armor, and use a resource called Rage Rage to cast spells and abilities.

Description:
Weapon masters and master tacticians, arms warriors are a type of Melee DPS specialization that utilizes their weapon to sunder their opponent's armor and wreak havoc upon the battlefield. As an arms warrior you are equipped with an arsenal of spells and abilities such as  Mortal Strike,  Whirlwind, and  Bladestorm to ravage your enemies as well as  Execute and  Hamstring to finish off your opponents, making sure there is no escape.
Pros:
-Strong execute damage
-Excellent cleave and AoE damage
-Flexible/versatile playstyles
Cons:
- Damage is dependent on build and cool downs
- Slow rotation

Description:
Bloodthirsty berserkers and fierce combatants, fury warriors are a type of Melee DPS specialization that utilizes their lust for warfare and two two-handed weapons to annihilate anyone who dares to stand in their way. As a fury warrior you are equipped with an arsenal of spells and abilities such as  Rampage,  Bloodthirst, and  Raging Blow to hack your enemies to shreds as well as  Recklessness,  Enraged Regeneration, and  Piercing Howl to strike fear into the hearts of your foes and sustain yourself with pure unbridled hatred.
Pros:
- Strong sustained AoE damage
- Can easily switch targets and alternate between single target and AoE damage
- Excellent burst AoE
Cons:
- Weak sustained and burst single target damage
- Damage suffers from downtime

Description:
Defenders of the weak, and resilient fighters that fight until their last breath, protection warriors, or prot warriors, are a type of Tank specialization that goes toe to toe with the enemy to protect allies from harm. As a prot warrior, you have access to an arsenal of spells and abilities such as  Ignore Pain,  Shield Wall, and  Last Stand to fortify yourself and strengthen your resolve,  Thunder Clap,  Shield Slam,  Intercept,  Taunt to prevent would-be attackers from harming your allies, and  Demoralizing Shout and  Spell Reflection to neutralize potential threats.
Pros:
- Strong personal damage reduction cooldowns and abilities
- Great utility
- Strong burst AoE damage
- Good at mitigating physical/blockable damage
Cons:
- Takes a lot of skill
- Limited self healing
- Susceptible to damage outside of  Shield Block

Weapon Masters:
One huge perk as a warrior is the ability to wield every weapon in the game except for Wands Wands. While this by no means that certain weapon types such as  Bows are remotely beneficial for warriors, farming weapon transmog on warriors is significantly easier than other classes.
Heroic Leap and Charge:
The next big perk that warriors have is the ability to  Heroic Leap and  Charge ( Intercept for Prot Warriors). These two spells combined are arguably one of the best mobility spells in the game because  Heroic Leap lets you leap out of harm's way to avoid certain abilities that could otherwise kill you or chase down an enemy that is trying to escape, and  Charge allows you to rush at a target and lock them down before they can escape. However, these spells can also be used in tandem with each other to increase dps/generate Rage Rage. For example, if you are fighting a target with limited mobility, you can  Heroic Leap away from your target then immediately  Charge back to generate free rage which you can use for defensive abilities as a prot warrior or dps as arms and fury."
General,Zones,"What is a Zone?
A zone is a unique region in World of Warcraft, with a distinctive environment that sets it apart from other zones. Each zone furthers the story of World of Warcraft in some way, and is visually-themed around the related lore. For example, the areas around the human city Stormwind have similar architecture—Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Duskwood, Redridge Mountains.

Most zones you can freely travel to via mount or flightpath, out in the open world. A small subset of zones (dungeons, raids, PvP), have additional requirements but these are not the first zones you will encounter playing.

  
  


Zones are filled with friendly NPCs in towns, and enemy NPCs who are needed to complete objectives. In the earliest zones, the surrounding area will be mostly friendly, and the enemy mobs will not be that challenging.

On Wowhead, you can browse a full list of zones, organized by level, continent and type. Here are links to our zones in Kalimdor and Zones in Eastern Kingdoms. You can also type in the name of a zone in the search box at the top right of a page to visit zone pages like Elwynn Forest. Here you will find screenshots, helpful comments, and a list of related NPCs and quests in the zone. We also have a map on zone pages with various things you can track, represented by a row of icons underneath the map. For example, you can click on the winged boot to bring up all the flight paths in a zone, or the Hearthstone to bring up the locations for all of the Inns.

Types of Zones
There are several types of zones in World of Warcraft:
Questing Zone: This is the first type of zone you will encounter. In this type of zone, you will complete quest objectives by killing hostile mobs and looting special items. These objectives also have a story component, culminating in a climatic event when you complete all parts of a zone. We have an overview of 1-60 questing zones to help you plan your path. If you are stuck completing a quest in game, simply type the name of the quest into Wowhead and a page will pop up with a map, screenshots, and useful tips on how to complete the quest.
City: These zones are friendly areas you can explore, with shops and monuments, much like a real city. You'll reach your first city around Level 10. Each city is the political center for a faction in Warcraft, so you can immerse yourself a bit in the culture and lore. There are also some special things you can do in a city like sell items on the Auction House and access your bank to store spare items, which is covered in more detail in the World of Warcraft City Guide.
Instance: These zones you will encounter periodically from level 10 onwards. Instance zones are group content that require you to be certain levels to unlock. There are several types of instanced content: dungeons (small groups), raids (large groups), and Player-vs-Player battlegrounds. If you want a change of pace from questing zones, these provide an alternative way to get experience at higher levels. The first dungeons you will encounter are The Deadmines and Ragefire Chasm.
Continent: This term is used to describe the large landmass a particular zone is in. For example, the city of Stormwind is located in the continent of Eastern Kingdoms. As a new player, you will mainly stay on either Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdom, based on what starting race you pick. As you level up, you will be able to quest on additional continents—Outland, Northrend, Pandaria, and Draenor.

Friendly/Hostile Zones
Some zones are friendly to either Alliance or Horde players, due to lore reasons. For example, a Horde player would be attacked trying to visit Stormwind. However, as a new player, you will be surrounded by friendly zones--the hostile zones are arranged to be farther away from your starting area. Wowhead zone pages will tell you if a zone is intended for one faction, or both.

Friendly mobs will have green nameplates and text, neutral mobs yellow, and hostile mobs red.



Please refer to our World of Warcraft Race Overview to learn more about what storyline is associated with each race and faction.

You do not need to worry about other players killing you. On most types of realms, both factions of players are peaceful by default. In addition, each city, town, and low-level area has guards which attack any player actively looking for a fight. If you are lost, and you seem to be heading towards a town but the guards have red nameplates and seem attackable, you have reached a town intended for the opposite faction.
Areas in an Outdoor Zone
This next part breaks down the different areas you will encounter in an outdoor questing zone:
The town: A town is a friendly area in a zone. There are several buildings and houses, including an Inn, which you can sit in to gain rested experience. There are also NPCs that let you repair your gear. There are NPCs to add flavor to a zone who sell themed food and drink, weapons, armor. These are more to add character to the zone and you don’t need to buy any of these items, although you can sell items taking up space in your bags to them. There are even some NPCs you can simply talk to, who will tell you more about the area.
Flight Master: Speak to this NPC to learn a new flight path. Talking to this NPC will then open up a map of all the places you can fly to. You can only fly to areas that you’ve found the Flight Master at, so don’t skip talking to them. Flying from area to area is faster than walking or riding.
Quest Hub: As you progress through questing and story lines, you will come across groups of friendly NPCs farther away from the town. These areas do not have as many amenities as a real Town, but you can turn in quests and possibly repair and access a mailbox.
The Road: Stay on the road to travel between destinations. The road is a friendly area where hostile mobs won’t spawn. However, if you are too low-level for the area, your presence may attract hostile mobs from farther away, who may run towards the road.
Caves and Mountains: Some quest objectives may seem close by on your map, but may require some extra travel because they are high above on a mountain or underground in a cave. Caves may seem a bit daunting to navigate at first, but there are special maps, as well as the minimap, to keep all the paths straight.
Enemy mobs: Most of an outdoor zone will have hostile mobs which are required for different quests as you progress through a zone. Killing these mobs will grant experience. However, it is more efficient to simply kill the amount of required mobs and head back to town to turn in your quest, instead of killing infinite mobs. It is also efficient to do all the quests in a particular area at one time, instead of traveling back and forth.
Rares: Some enemy mobs will have a fancy silver portrait around their image. These have better-than-expected loot and experience rewards. They are not required for quest objectives but are worth defeating for their rewards.
Elites: Some enemy mobs will have a fancy gold portrait around their image. These are mostly found in instances, like dungeons or raids. When you see this portrait, it’s a hint that you’re in an area that requires a group to defeat.
Treasure Chests: As you level up, you will discover chests out in the world. These may have pleasant surprises, like gear, food or drink!
Natural Environment: Some areas may not appear to serve any particular purpose, but are very pretty and set the mood for the zone! Waterfalls, mountain vistas, small houses, gardens, etc. Take the time to relax and enjoy the scenery, and take a screenshot if you like the area.
World of Warcraft Map
The in-game map helps you navigate around a zone. To open the big map, press the letter M. This will open up a map, along with quests you have in that zone on the right-hand side. You can view different maps by using the navigation menu in the map panel. If you move while the map is open, the map will dim, allowing you to see your surrounding better."
General,Cities,"What is a City?
A city is a large peaceful zone you will encounter around level 10. Unlike questing zones or instances, there are no mobs to kill here--just a fun city to explore, hang out with other players, and catch up on in-game errands.

Here are some of the useful things you can do in a city:
Auction House: Buy and sell important items of value by listing or placing bids.
Bank: Store important items in your personal bank or your Void Storage. You can also access your guild bank, if you belong to a guild.
Class Trainers: Speak to class trainers to reset your chosen specialization or learn dual specialization. These trainers are often found in a themed-area, adding a bit of personality to your chosen class.
Barbershop: Change your character's hair style, color, or other customizations.
Experience: You'll automatically be well-rested in a city, increasing the amount of time you'll gain experience faster when you go back out into the world.
Inn: Talk to an Innkeeper to set your Hearthstone Hearthstone to a major city. You can set your Hearthstone Hearthstone at Inns around the world, but it's most convenient to set it in a major city for access to features like trainers, the AH, and bank.
Profession Trainers: Learn new recipes, as well as profession levels, from trainers in capital cities. These trainers are usually next to vendors who sell materials that will aid you in leveling up professions.
Transportation: Cities contain useful transportation options that let you get around faster than regular gryphons: portals, zeppelins, and boats.
If you are not sure where to find something, ask a city guard NPC for directions. They will put a marker on your minimap where your destination is.

Each city has a bit of local flavor and unique architecture as well. There are memorials, statues, and gardens that reflect each city's culture. Even the food and drink sold tends to vary from city to city.
Alliance Cities
Darnassus
Darnassus is the capital town of the Night Elves. The city is arranged in a series of terraces around the central tree surrounded by a lake. Large stone structures stand next to tiered wooden shops--everything is covered in flowers and vines. The city is guarded by elemental nature protectors as well as the Sentinels. There is an aura of tranquility surrounding the nature-filled city.

Areas of Interest: The Temple Gardens is at the center of Darnassus, connecting to other terraces with bridges over a central lake. Terraces surrounding the lake house trainers, battlemasters, and shopkeepers. In northern Darnassus you will find The Howling Oak, a new home for Gilnean refugees. The Temple of the Moon is the center of worship for the Sisters of Elune, where Tyrande Whisperwind and Malfurion Stormrage reside.

Transportation: Darnassus is located in Teldrassil, north west of Kalimdor. The most common way to reach Darnassus is to take a boat from Stormwind to Rut'theran Village and then use the large teleport in Rut'theran. Darnassus is a city you'll encounter naturally as either a Night Elf, Draenei or Worgen.

Darnassus has a portal to Exodar, and boats to both Exodar and Stormwind.

History: In the aftermath of the Third War, the night elves had to adjust to their mortal existence. Such an adjustment was far from easy, and there were many night elves who could not adjust to the prospects of aging, disease and frailty. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward druids conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world.

With Malfurion Stormrage missing, Fandral Staghelm--the leader of those who wished to plant the new World Tree--became the new Arch-Druid. He and his fellow druids had forged ahead and planted the great tree, Teldrassil, off the stormy coasts of northern Kalimdor. However, it was corrupted by the Burning Legion and the night elves never regained their immortality.

Darnassus in Battle for Azeroth: Due to the events of the War of the Thorns, Darnassus was burned down and ultimately destroyed by the Horde, lead by Sylvanas Windrunner. The survivors of the war moved and settled in Stormwind City, whilst some others were evacuated to the Azuremyst Isle. The Alliance response to the Horde for these events was the Siege of Lordaeron.


Exodar
The Exodar is the capital city of the Draenei. It is located in the westernmost part of Azuremyst Isle. The Exodar's faction leader is Prophet Velen, who is located near the battlemasters in the Vault of Lights. The Exodar is brightly-colored and covered in crystals and glowing lights.

Areas of Interest: The Exodar is split into the Seat of the Naaru, home of O'ros the naaru, with three wings. The Crystal Hall is home to a crystal mine and class trainers, including Shaman who give players Elemental Sapta Elemental Sapta allowing them to see elementals. The Vault of Lights is the central tiered wing where Prophet Velen resides. It is also home to a holographic museum showing the horrors of the Burning Legion the Draenei have continually been escaping from over thousands of years. The Trader's Tier is where you will find profession and guild vendors.

Transportation: The Exodar is located in northern Kalimdor on Azuremyst Isle. It is a bit out of the way, and the most common way to reach the city is to take a portal from Darnassus. Draenei are most likely to frequent this city. There is also a boat connecting the Exodar to Darnassus.

History: The history of the Exodar is a short one, as the draenei only recently raised it around the husk of their crashed ship, which is still smoking from the impact. The Exodar was once a naaru satellite structure around the dimensional fortress Tempest Keep. The Exodar contains a large amount of technological wonders (due to its origins lying with the Tempest Keep) such as magically enchanted ""wires"" which transport holy energy throughout the ship to power the heating and lighting.

Ironforge
Ironforge is the capital city of the dwarves. It is am intricate circular cavern carved into the mountains of Dun Morogh, with a massive forge near flight paths at the center. It is primarily populated by dwarves, but there is a strong gnomish presence in Tinker Town.

Areas of Interest: The Hall of Explorers is home to the Ironforge Library and Museum, maintained by the Explorer's League which is interested in learning more about the Titan origins of the dwarves. The Great Forge is an impressive sight to behold, with a large pool of molten lava. The Throne Room is home to the three leaders from each clan; you can take a turn down into Old Ironforge, a series of stairways and tunnels leading to Magni Bronzebeard, the former leader of Ironforge now encased in crystals.

Transportation: Ironforge is located in central Eastern Kingdoms. Gnomes, dwarves, and humans will encounter this city frequently. The most common way to reach Ironforge is by taking the Deeprum Tram from Stormwind. From Ironforge, you can take the tram back to Stormwind or portal to the Dark Portal.

History:
Ironforge is the ancient home of the dwarves. A marvel to the dwarves' skill at shaping rock and stone, Ironforge was constructed in the very heart of the mountains, an expansive underground city home to explorers, miners, and warriors. Before the Dark Iron Clan was banished from the city, eventually leading to the War of the Three Hammers, Ironforge was the commercial and social center of all the dwarven clans. Once dominated by the Bronzebeard Clan, the Dark Iron and Wildhammer clans have a strong presence in Cataclysm.

Relatively recently, Ironforge also became home to the Gnomeregan refugees. After the Third War, the gnomish city of Gnomeregan became overrun by troggs. Since then, a number of gnomes have settled in Ironforge, converting an area of that city to their liking, an area now known as Tinker Town.

Stormwind
Stormwind City is the capital city of the Alliance. It is located in the northwestern part of Elwynn Forest. Formerly ruled by the young child king Anduin Wrynn (with the help of Highlord Bolvar Fordragon, the former regent, and Lady Katrana Prestor), it is now ruled over by King Varian Wrynn who returned during the time of the Lich King.

Areas of Interest:
Stormwind is divided into districts, separated by canals. In the Mage Quarter, you will find a mystical tower where mages study, as well as the seedy inn The Slaughtered Lamb where Warlocks lurk. The Trade District is one of the busiest areas in the game, where players congregate naturally, as well as home to the suspicious Trias cheese shop. In the Valley of Heroes, you will find monuments to heroes from the Second War. In Old Town, you'll find the home of rogue organization SI:7, while in Cathedral Square, you'll find the magnificent Cathedral of Light, as well as the City Hall and Orphanage. Behind the Cathedral you will find Stormwind's massive graveyard, including a monument to Varian's wife.

Stormwind Keep is the political heart of the Alliance; here you will find the throne room and leaders.

Lion's Rest - 'a place of contemplation and remembrance' - can be found between Cathedral Square and the Mage Quarter. It was built over the site of the former Park and Old Barracks, destroyed by Deathwing.

Stormwind is home to a number of cultural references and Easter Eggs, including Bernard Gump and Elizabeth Birdsong. The auctioneers are named after some Blizzard employees as well!

Transportation: Stormwind is a major transportation hub. The Stormwind Harbor has boats to Teldrassil in Kalimdor and Borean Tundra in Northrend. The Dwarven District in Stormwind also provides easy access to Ironforge. There is a hub of portals you can unlock at higher levels that will connect you to some questing zones as well. Stormwind is mostly used by Humans while leveling, but it's a busy city for all races.

History During the First War, the Kingdom of Azeroth, including its capital, Stormwind Keep, was utterly destroyed by the Horde and its survivors fled to Lordaeron. After the orcs were defeated at the Dark Portal at the end of the Second War, it was decided that the city would be rebuilt. The nobles of Stormwind assembled a team of the most skilled and ingenious stonemasons and architects they could find--which later turned sour and led to the rise of the Defias.

With the fall of the northern kingdoms, Stormwind is by far the most populated city in the world. It serves in many ways as the cultural and trade center of the Alliance, even with remote access to the sea. It is home to the Academy of Arcane Sciences, the only wizarding school in Eastern Kingdoms, as well as SI:7, a rogue intelligence organization.


Horde Cities
Orgrimmar
Orgrimmar is the capital city of the Horde, with large settlements of trolls, orcs, tauren, and goblins. At the start of World of Warcraft, the position of Warchief was held by Thrall. It was later passed to Garrosh Hellscream, and after a period of political turmoil, the troll Vol'jin is now the Warchief.

Areas of Interest: The Valley of Strength lies at the center of Orgrimmar, home to the residing Warchief and much of the city's commerce. The Valley of Spirits is more residential, with neighborhoods for the Goblins and Trolls reflecting their distinctive cultures. Underneath Orgrimmar lies The Cleft of Shadow and Ragefire Chasm, a reminder of the dark past of the orcs and their corruption by the Burning Legion.

Transportation: Orcs, Tauren, Goblins, and Trolls will frequent Orgrimmar while leveling, but it's the busiest city for all races. Orgrimmar is a major transportation hub, with zeppelins that can take you to Thunder Bluff, Undercity, Grom'gol in Stranglethorn Vale, or Borean Tundra in Northrend. There is a hub of portals you can unlock at higher levels that will connect you to some questing zones as well.

History:
Thrall led the orcs to the continent of Kalimdor, where they founded a new homeland, naming it Durotar after Thrall's murdered father. Rising above their past bloodshed and demonic curse, the orcs built a society based on survival and prosperity rather than conquest.

Named after the former Warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, Orgrimmar was constructed in a short amount of time, with the aid of goblins, tauren, trolls, and Rexxar. Orgrimmar has undergone a visual update when Garrosh took control, to look more aggressive and militaristic with numerous spikes and fortifications.

Today, Orgrimmar lies at the base of a mountain between Durotar and Azshara. Times have changed though, since Garrosh's reign as Warchief--he has alienated several races due to his aggressive and insecure nature. In the raid Siege of Orgrimmar, players can see the result of Garrosh's damage to the city and fight to reclaim it for its citizens.

Silvermoon City
Silvermoon City is the capital of the Blood Elves. It is an elegant city, showing off the wealth and refined tastes of its citizens. The city is covered in gold decorations, reflecting the Blood Elves' love of the sun.

Areas of Interest: The Walk of Elders is the central hub of the city, with autumnal trees and numerous benches lining the paths, as well as the residence of the famous band The Tauren Chieftans. Sunfury Spire is home to the Royal Palace and Court of the Sun, where Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron resides, surrounded by his advisers and magical libraries. Farstrider Square is home to two Blood Elf groups: the Farstriders, a group of rangers, and the formidable Blood Knight Paladins. The Bazaar is the flourishing business center of Silvermoon and home to the grand Wayfarer's Inn, but the nearby Murder Row reveals a more sinister side in the darkened alleyways, as well as Keelen's Trustworthy Tailoring which hires leper gnomes to work nonstop in the basement. While Silvermoon appears to be a flourshing city, the magical green crystals throughout the city remind the player that the Blood Elves are addicted to magic.

Transportation: Silvermoon City is primarily visited by Blood Elves while leveling, as it's a bit out of the way in northern Eastern Kingdoms. You can get to Silvermoon City easily from Undercity via the Orb of Translocution.

History: The city of Silvermoon was founded by the high elves after their arrival in Lordaeron thousands of years ago. The city was constructed in the style of the ancient Kaldorei Empire. The city contained the famous Academies of Silvermoon as a center for the learning of Arcane Magic and Sunstrider Spire, a majestic palace home to the Royal family of the high elves. The Convocation of Silvermoon (also known as ""The Silvermoon Council""), the ruling body of the high elves was also based here.

Although Silvermoon itself was left relatively unscathed from the second war, in the third war the Death Knight Arthas led the Scourge into the city, attacking it on his quest to reach the Sunwell. The High Elven King was slain and the majority of the population killed.

Silvermoon today is only the eastern half of the original city; the western half was almost completely destroyed by the Scourge during the Third War. Falconwing Square, the second blood elf town, is the only part of western Silvermoon remaining in blood elf control.


Thunder Bluff
Thunder Bluff is the Tauren capital city located in the northern part of the region of Mulgore. The whole of the city is built on bluffs several hundred feet above the surrounding landscape, and is accessible by elevators on the southwestern and northeastern sides.

Areas of Interest: The High Rose on the central mesa is home to High Chieftan Baine Bloodhoof. Nearby is an open-air auditorium used to make important events. Elder Rise is the spiritual center of Thunder Bluff, home to the Council of Elders and the Cenarion Circle. The Spirit Rise is the center for Shaman training, with the Pool of Visions below. The final plateau, Hunter Rise, is home to military training, the Hunter's Hall, and Sunwalker Lodge.

Transportation: Thunder Bluff is primarily used by Taurens while leveling. To access the city on top of the plateau, you must take one of the elevators up. If you fall off the city, you will take fall damage and die. Within the city, there are three distinctive plateaus off of a main plateau that has multiple tiers--Lower to the southwest, Middle to the northeast, and High to the east.

Thunder Bluff is connected to Orgrimmar via a zeppelin.

History: Thunder Bluff lies atop a series of mesas overlooking Mulgore. The once nomadic Tauren recently built the city as a center for trade caravans, traveling craftsmen and artisans of every kind. It was established by the mighty chief Cairne Bloodhoof after the Tauren, with help from the orcs, drove away the centaurs that originally inhabited Mulgore.

Undercity
The Undercity is the capital city of the Undead. It is built under the remains of the city of Lordaeron. It is foul and dark, with twisted gothic architecture and plague-green canals. The Undercity is laid out in a circular pattern, with four wings off of a central canal.

Areas of Interest: On your way to the Undercity, you'll find the Lordaeron Throne Room--untouched from years of political upheaval. If you look closely, you'll find a trail of blood on the ground near the throne. Proceeding into the city, you'll come across the sinister Apothecarium, home to the Royal Apothecary Society which seeks to create plague to use against enemies. Each quarter in the Undercity is devoted to a different type of combat, with the Magic Quarter the most sinister as it houses the Temple of the Damned devoted to necromatic energies.

Transportation: The Undercity is a major hub for zeppelins, which travel to Orgrimmar, Howling Fjord in Northrend, and Grom'gol in Stranglethorn Vale. There is also an orb, off to the right of the Ruins of Lordaeron, that lets you quickly teleport to Silvermoon City.

The Undercity is a bit challenging for new players to navigate at first, as it is underground the Ruins of Lordaeron. To enter the city, pass by the courtyard and throne room into any of the winding passageways. You will find an elevator, guarded by Abominations, that takes you down into the city.

History: The Undercity was originally simply a system of sewers, crypts, and catacombs beneath the Capital City of Lordaeron. After the city was destroyed by the Scourge, Arthas had the underground warren expanded and rebuilt. He originally intended for the Undercity to be his seat of power, from which he would rule the Plaguelands. However, shortly after the Third War ended, Arthas was forced to return to Northrend and save the Lich King. In his absence, Sylvanas Windrunner and her rebel Undead captured the ruins of the city. Soon after, she discovered the massive underground fortress, and decided to establish it as the main base of operations for the Undead Forsaken.

After the Forsaken were betrayed by Grand Apothecary Putress at Wrathgate, who split off from the Horde to launch a lethal chemical assault, the Forsaken were nevertheless mistrusted by the rest of the Horde. They have tried to demonstrate their loyalty in various ways, such as attacking the kingdom of Gilneas.

Undercity in Battle for Azeroth: Following the events of the Burning of Teldrassil, the Alliance set out to repay the favor to the Horde through the Siege of Lordaeron. This battle was fought for the control of Undercity and resulted in the Alliance's victory. However, their victory was snatched from their palms as the Horde ended up destroying Undercity and leaving the Alliance with nothing more than the Ruins of Lordaeron.


Higher-Level Cities
At higher levels, you will come across cities for both factions. Here are a few of the notable ones.
Dalaran
Dalaran is a magocratic city-state and was once located within the Alterac Mountains in the Eastern Kingdoms. Now, the city, including the Violet Citadel, resides above the Crystalsong Forest in Northrend. The top part of the city is sparkling and airy, while the sewers underground show the darker side of magic addiction and luxury.

The Violet Citadel is center of the Kirin Tor, with portals to the luxury balcony bar The Purple Parlor, as well as the secret room Archmage Vargoth's Retreat. There are lavish areas for the Alliance and Horde, the Silver Enclave and Sunreaver's Sanctuary, that include luxury inns and other nice touches like a beer garden. Dalaran is home to the Antonidas Memorial, named after Archmange Antonidas, a former leader of the Kirin Tor who was killed by Arthas. There is also a special fountain--fish up enough coins and you could get Titanium Seal of Dalaran Titanium Seal of Dalaran.

The shops of Dalaran reflect the luxury of the city. There are shops for wine and cheese, companion pets, hats, and shirts. The area for the profession trainers is whimsical, with each shop reflecting the theme of each profession. For example, the Herbalism NPC is found in a conservatory while the Jewelcrafting NPC is in a jewelry shop.

Dalaran was introduced as the neutral city for the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, similiar to how Shattrath City was introduced as the neutral city for the The Burning Crusade expansion.

Dalaran has always attracted mages from its very beginnings, serving as a center for magic and research. Unfortunately, this strong center for magic also attracted the Burning Legion. Unwilling to give up magic, the inhabitants of Dalaran appointed a Guardian as well as the Order of Tirisfal for protection, and founded the Kirin Tor to document all magic in Azeroth. Although it had Alliance ties, Dalaran remained politically neutral, believeing itself above petty politics.

Dalaran was first destroyed by Archimonde, summoned by Kel'Thuzad from Medivh's spellbook which Arthas acquired. However, the mages were redetermined to build the city even grander than before. This city was later moved to Northrend to better fight the threats of Malygos and Arthas in Wrath of the Lich King.

These factions have different tiered areas high above the center of the city.

General,Items,"What is an Item?
An item is a possession that the player owns. These items can be stored in a backpack, bank, or void storage. A subset of items, gear, can be equipped on the player and has a unique appearance everyone nearby will see.

There are many different categories of items:
Weapons: Held in character’s hands, these offer substantial increases to player power, and in the case of melee, greatly affect the amount of damage a player deals.
Armor: Armor serves two purposes as clothing in World of Warcraft. Each piece of armor increases your character’s power by added stats, and in some cases like trinkets, additional bonus effects. Each armor piece also has unique visuals and many players enjoy finding matching pieces of armor to express their personality.
Containers: Players can acquire additional bags to store their new items. Many bags are multi-purpose, but some are specific to professions. For example, Burnished Inscription Bag Burnished Inscription Bag is roomier than your average bag, but only holds Inscription items.
Consumables: These types of items temporarily buff a player, such as Flasks to increase a stat for a few hours, food to regain your health, and enchants to give your weapon additional effects. These items are usually made by players that have trained in a specific profession, and can be traded or bought on the Auction House.
Glyphs: A glyph is a scroll that enhances certain abilities, either giving them additional utility or a cosmetic effect like changing the color of a spell.
Trade Goods: You will need these items to create consumables, whether it’s meat for food that buffs your stats, herbs for Alchemy potions, or leather for Armor.
Recipes: When players learn a profession, they discover how to craft items via recipes. Recipes can be acquired many different ways—several popular sources are trainers, bosses, and reputation grinds.
Gems: At higher levels, players can socket gems into their gear. Gems with stronger stat gains are available as players level up.
Mounts: Many players love collecting mounts, adding to their collection totals.
Pets: Some battle pets can be captured directly in the world, but others are found as items from bosses, vendors, etc. Clicking on the pet item will teach you the pet permanently.
Quest: When completing a quest, sometimes you will be required to loot a specific item. These items will not take up bag space when you acquire them.
Item Tooltips and Terms
An item’s tooltip reveals many useful details about an item.

Quality: The name of an item will be in a certain color: Poor, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary. These colors roughly show how important and useful an item is.
Item Level: This increases the overall level of your gear. As you level up and look for groups for challenging content, some leaders may require your item level to be above a certain number to prove you are not undergeared for the content.
Bind Information: Items can have the following bind types:
Bind on Equip: These items refer to gear which can be traded or sold on the AH until a character equips it.
Binds when Used: These items cover some toys, pets, and mounts which can be traded or bought until someone learns the item.
Binds to Account: Commonly referred to as heirlooms, these items can be passed around all characters on your account, including gear that is already worn.
Binds when Picked Up: This is what most equippable gear is classified as—an item you acquire (questing, a boss, crafting)-with the specific intent you’ll use it. When you have no more need for the item, you can sell or Disenchant it, or hold onto it in your bags for its visual appearance.
Restrictions: Sometimes an item will list additional restrictions, like 3 crafting items, or a profession requirement. Other items can only be equipped by a certain class, for example a piece of armor that boosts an ability only one class has.
Stats and Effects: This part of the tooltip will show the stats you will gain by equipping an item or using a consumable. For gear, if you mouse over an item’s tooltip, it will automatically compare that item to your equipped item to show gains and loses.
Level Requirement: This shows what level your character must be to equip something. If you are too low-level to equip something, you can hold onto it in your bags until you are old enough to use it.
Flavor Text: Only a handful of items have flavor text. This does not add anything to an item, but denotes it has some special place in the game’s lore and reveals a little about the item’s previous history.

Acquiring Items
Items can be acquired many ways:

Achievement: These items are rare and special, they are rewards for completing a large amount of content.
Black Market Auction House: Very rare, or otherwise unobtainable items, are sometimes randomly put on the BMAH. Players can outbid each other, spending large amounts of money, to win these coveted items.
Crafted: These items come from players who have learned a specific profession.
Drop: This encompasses the widest range of items, basically everything you can loot as you’re playing WoW. At higher levels, specific useful items drop from NPCs in dungeons and raids, and many players will re-run an instance to acquire a particular item.
Event: A handful of items are related to participating in an in game event, like WoW’s Anniversary.
In-Game Shop: Some items can be purchased with real money, such as distinctive mounts and pets. We have a guide to how to purchase items and what all the options are.
Missions: High-level players with access to the Warlords Garrison or Legion Order Hall can complete missions that reward items.
PvP: Items aimed at Player-vs-Player combat are rewards from either PvP vendors or from loot boxes rewarded after winning.
Quest: These items are automatically rewarded when you finish a quest.
Redemption: A handful of items are expensive rewards for things like buying a Collector’s Edition or watching BlizzCon on the Virtual Ticket. Another type of redemption item is Trading Card Loot, items that were part of the now-defunct TCG and have distinctive appearances and silly effects.
Starter: These items are the very basics that you will have when you create a new character in WoW.
Vendor: Items can be purchased from vendors by clicking on the NPC, and then clicking on the item you want to buy. Many vendors are simply there for flavor, but some vendors sell useful items. For example, a cooking vendor in a capital city may sell you a recipe unique to that culture.
You can set your loot options to Auto Loot in Game Menu > Interface > Controls.
Storing Items
When you acquire an item, it automatically will go into your bag. If you have no bag space, you will receive an error message that your bags are full.

Once you have bag space, you can loot the new item again. Sometimes you will find the item mailed to you if your bags are full.

There are ways to increase your bag space if you want to hold onto many things:

Find bags that have more bag slots. We have two guides about bags, the comprehensive Big Bag guide, and an overview of the easiest bags to get
Buy additional slots for your bank, and put a large-sized bag in each slot. Banks can be accessed in all major cities. A bank starts off with 28 slots for free, and seven additional slots can be purchased for 111 10 total.
Utilize the Reagents bank tab for your profession-related materials. This special bank tab has 60 slots and costs 100 to unlock. Hit the ""Deposit All Reagents"" button to automatically clean up your bags.
If you have extra money, spend some gold to put infrequently-used items in Void Storage. Each item costs 10 to deposit. Void Storage has 160 slots total across two tabs. However, there are some restrictions on Void Storage items—-they cannot be BoE, stacked items, or consumables, plus storing them will remove all enchants, gems, and other enhancements. Accessing your Void Storage can only be done in Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Mists of Pandaria, and Warlords capital cities.
Create a “bank alt” designed to hold onto miscellaneous items.
Blizzard has automatic built-in storage for some vanity collections: Mounts, Pets, Toys, and Heirlooms. Click on ""Shift-P"" to open up the collection tab. From there, you can click on an item to summon or use it. These items are mostly just-for-fun and we have guides to each type of collection: the Warlords Mount Guide, Toy Box Guide, Heirloom List, and Battle Pet Guides. The in-game collection tab has additional information on these types of items, such as their source and attributes.
Getting Rid of Items
There are several ways to get rid of items you do not want.
Delete: Delete an item by clicking on it, then clicking on the center of your screen. If the item is of a good quality, you will have to type “Delete” when prompted to verify you want to delete the useful item. Deleting an item should be a last resort, as you do not get any gold for removing the item this way.
Sell to Vendor: This is a safer way to handle junk items you do not want. You can go up to a merchant NPC, click on their “Sell” tab and then right-click on items you do not want. As each item is sold, you will gain small amounts of gold. The junk items in your bag will have little gold icons in the corner, indicating they have no real purpose other than to be sold. It is still worth looting and selling trash, vs completely ignoring it, as some items reward a decent amount of gold like Robble's Staff of Herding Robble's Staff of Herding.
Mail: You can mail items to anyone on your realm (same faction) or any of your characters on your account.
Trade: If you have a friend that needs a particular item, go up to that player, click on their portrait, and select the Trade option. Drag the item into the window that opens up so they can accept the trade.
Auction House: If an item seems particularly valuable, you can list it on the AH in a major city. For example, a BoE piece of gear with a unique model or a rare profession material you have no use for. Use the Auction House UI to see if other people have listed the same item, to get a sense of how rare your item is and how you should price it.
Disenchant: Enchanters have the option to shard useful items for crafting materials, which are then used to craft powerful enchants. High-level players in Warlords of Draenor can build an Enchanter's Study and use it to disenchant items, even if they do not have the profession.


Gear Basics and Stats
Gear is a subset of items that your character can wear. This gear has two purposes: to affect the appearance of your character, and to strengthen your character’s power.

For information on item appearances and how to alter the appearance of your gear, please visit our Transmogrification Tools Overview and Transmog Guide section.

At low levels, you do not need to worry too much about the stats on your gear. Pick the gear that has your primary stat, and equip any item you come across that has more of that primary stat.

Strength: Warriors, Protection and Retribution Paladin, Death Knights
Intellect: Mage, Priest, Warlock, Elemental and Restoration Shaman, Balance and Restoration Druid, Holy Paladin, Mistweaver Monk
Additional stats include Critical Strike, Mastery, Stamina, and Versatility. These are not as important as making sure you equip an item with the right primary stat.

The class you choose affects the type of armor that is optimal:
Cloth - Priest, Mage, Warlock
Leather - Rogue, Druid, Monk, Demon Hunter
Mail - Hunter, Shaman
Plate - Warrior, Paladin, Death Knight
Classes can wear armor a tier below their optimal one, but it is considered subpar.

Loot Specialization
As you level up, the types of gear you acquire will matter more for your specialization. You can right-click on your character portrait to set your Loot Specialization. You can set your Loot Specialization to a different spec than your current one, if you are interested in collecting off-spec loot.

By pre-selecting a loot specialization, all items acquired from questing, Bonus Rolls, and LFR will be suited to your specialization. This will also affect what you can roll /Need or /Greed on in group content."

Gnome
gnomes.pngOverview: The gnomes are a quirky race, obsessed with gadgets and technology. They originally come from the city of (Zone #133), which was destroyed by High Tinker Mekkatorque in an attempt to save it from an invading army of troggs.

Their leader, Gelbin Mekkatorque, built the first mechanostrider and led the campaign to retake Gnomeregan. The city of Gnomeregan initially fell when faced with a surprise invasion by the troggs. The radiation treatment to kill the troggs instead weakened them, and they spread throughout the city, infecting and killing many Gnomish citizens. To make matters worse, Gelbin's adviser Sicco Thermaplugg engineered the defense failure, hoping to frame Gelbin and seize control of the city. The gnomes stood beyond Gelbin and made their way to Ironforge for refuge; Thermaplugg remained inside Gnomeregan and became king of the leper gnomes.

During the First War, the Kingdom of Azeroth, including its capital, Stormwind Keep, was utterly destroyed by the Horde and its survivors fled to Lordaeron. After the orcs were defeated at the Dark Portal at the end of the Second War, it was decided that the city would be rebuilt. The nobles of Stormwind assembled a team of the most skilled and ingenious stonemasons and architects they could find--which later turned sour and led to the rise of the Defias.

With the fall of the northern kingdoms, Stormwind is by far the most populated city in the world. It serves in many ways as the cultural and trade center of the Alliance, even with remote access to the sea. It is home to the Academy of Arcane Sciences, the only wizarding school in Eastern Kingdoms, as well as SI:7, a rogue intelligence organization.

Culture: The humans were descended from Vrykul affected by the Curse of Flesh; instead of killing the weaker members of the tribe, some families escaped to start life afresh.

The humans revere the Titan Tyr, whose actions reflected his selfless nature, that sacrifice is required for justice. When Tyr decided to steal the Discs of Norgannon from Loken, a betrayer of the Titans, many titan-forged creations now cursed decided to escape with him. This escape led to a dramatic showdown between Tyr and two of Loken's greatest generals, in which Tyr sacrificed himself to destroy the enemy. Moved by this sacrifice, the vrykul decided to guard Tyr's resting place and settle in the new land--Tirisfal.

This loyalty and nobility in humans has led them to create massive armies and the Knights of the Silver Hand Paladin Order.


Night Elf
nightelves.pngOverview: The night elves are a mysterious race whose thirst for magic and power created a flourishing, yet corrupt, ancient empire. This empire had a dark side, drawing the attention of the Burning Legion which led to the War of the Ancients and The Sundering, a massive arcane explosion that ripped the world apart. The new generation of night elves shunned arcane magic and instead rebuilt their civilization to live in harmony with nature. They lived in Kalimdor for thousands of years, undisturbed until the world tree and their immortality was sacrificed to halt a new advance of the Burning Legion prior to the events of World of Warcraft.

Capital City: The night elf capital city is Darnassus, situated in the branches of the world tree itself. The city is home to the Temple of the Moon, the center of worship of Elune.

Zones: Night Elves begin in Teldrassil, learning about the recent political changes in Darnassus and threat of the Emerald Nightmare. Other zones which focus on night elf lore include Darkshore, Ashenvale, Desolace, Feralas, Felwood, and Mount Hyjal.

Culture: The leaders of the Night Elves are Tyrande Whisperwind and Malfurion Stormrage. Tyrande, the High Priestess of Elune, served as the sole ruler of the Night Elves during the Long Vigil while Malfurion slept in the Emerald Dream. Malfurion was the first Druid and formed the Cenarion Circle, an order devoted to protecting nature and druidic traditions.

Night Elf culture is matriarchal, with most women as warriors and men as Druids (although the rules have grown less restrictive in years, commemorated in  Druid and Priest Statue Set). The Sentinels are skilled warriors, fighting either with glaives or bows at range. You can find Sentinels defending any of the major Night Elf cities. The Sisters of Elune are a group of priestesses devoted to the goddess Elune. The Druids are protectors of nature, spending much of their time in a trance in the Emerald Dream.

The Night Elves have enjoyed a close relationship with the Wild Gods and Dragonflights. Cenarius blessed the early Night Elves, appreciative of their curiosity for nature. After the Sundering, the Dragonflights blessed the Night Elves and planted the first World Tree, Nordrassil.

Pandaren
pandaren.pngOverview: Couched in myth and legend, rarely seen and even more rarely understood, the enigmatic pandaren have long been a mystery to the other races of Azeroth. The noble history of the pandaren people stretches back thousands of years, well before the empires of man and before even the sundering of the world.

Denizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren once labored under the oppressive thumb of a monstrous race of ancient warlords known as the Mogu. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, the pandaren staged a successful revolution that deposed the Mogu and established a pandaren empire that would prosper for thousands of years.

During the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when demons flooded onto Azeroth and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the last Emperor of the pandaren discovered a way to protect his land from the devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left Pandaria haunted ever since...

Pandaren are unique in that players go through the starting zone, The Wandering Isle, neutral. The events in the starting zone will then force them to pick a side, permanently aligning themselves with either the Alliance or the Horde. Once a side is taken, Pandaren across factions can still communicate with each other.

Capital City: The Pandaren have two capital cities located in Vale of Eternal Blossoms: Shrine of Seven Stars and Shrine of Two Moons. These cities are lavish, covered in precious stones and gold carvings, to show the vibrant Pandaren culture.

Zones: Pandaren begin on The Wandering Isle. Life on the Wandering Isle is pacific and enlightening until the day the Wandering Isle travels through the seas near Azeroth’s Maelstrom. The ground becomes unstable, crops wilt, and Shen-zin Su seems to wobble in the ocean, drifting in an unsteady pattern that may be a death spiral. The entire continent of Pandaria is also dedicated to the culture of the Pandaren: Kun-Lai Summit, Townlong Steppes, The Jade Forest, Krasarang Wilds, Valley of the Four Winds, Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Timeless Isle.

Classes: Hunter Hunter, Mage Mage, Monk Monk, Priest Priest, Rogue Rogue, Shaman Shaman, Warrior Warrior. Pandaren are a natural fit for monks; their style of combat developed in Pandaria.

Mounts: Vendors in Stormwind and Orgrimmar sell turtle mounts. These mounts include Reins of the Purple Dragon Turtle Reins of the Purple Dragon Turtle and Reins of the Great Purple Dragon Turtle Reins of the Great Purple Dragon Turtle.

Battle Pets: Pandaria-themed pets include cute elementals like Pandaren Earth Spirit, dragonlings like Mechanical Pandaren Dragonling and Wild Golden Hatchling, and of course pandas. The first hint of the Pandaren was the shop pet Pandaren Monk, but many have been added since including Snowy Panda and Mountain Panda.

Appearance: Pandaren are quite similar to Pandas, with red and black fur options! They also come with cheerfully-colored hair streaks. Create your character's appearance in Wowhead's Dressing Room.

Culture: Pandaren, like Dwarves, are known for their love of brews--the Monk Tank specialization is called Brewmaster. You can find inhabitants of Pandaria creating brews all over the continent, notably Stormstout Brewery.

After the Mogu Empire dissolved, the Zandalari wanted to claim the land promised to them by Lei Shen - northern Kun-Lai Summit. The Pandaren, who felt no need to maintain a military, were badly outmatched until a young Pandaren, Jiang, defeated the Zandalari while fighting on a trained cloud serpent. Desperate, the Zandalari sought to resurrect Lei Shen, but Jiang sacrificed herself, killing the troll leader Mengai in the process. Jiang’s legacy was honored by preserving her teachings and passing them down in the Order of the Cloud Serpent. Players can gain reputation with Order of the Cloud Serpent to learn how to ride cloud serpents like Reins of the Golden Cloud Serpent Reins of the Golden Cloud Serpent. For this reputation grind, you help raise a hatchling to maturity and compete in races with other cloud serpent riders. This faction rewards jewelcrafting panther patterns, capturable wild serpent battle pets, pet toys, and cloud serpent mounts.

Back in the days of captivity, Kang, a young brewmaster, realized that the Mogu’s cruelty was a sign of weakness, not strength. Without servants, they were nothing. As the Pandaren were forbidden weapons, he taught himself how to fight unarmed with a unique “dancing” style relying on inner strength. lave rebellions started and the Mogu quickly crumbled without slaves to rely upon. In the final battle, both sides sustained serious losses, including Kang. This incited some Pandaren to turn to revenge, but Kang’s pupil Song reminded Pandaren about their pursuit for justice. Song became the first “lorewalker,” traveling around Pandaria to spread parables about their culture. The unique “dancing” style can be seen in the martial arts animations of the Monk class in combat. The Pandaren's values of peace and inner strength are reflected in their tranquil landscapes, Tian Monastery in The Jade Forest, and Peak of Serenity.

Worgen
worgen.pngOverview: The Worgen are a cursed race comprised of the people of Gilneas who have been afflicted by an ancient druidic curse, causing them to transform into deadly half-worg half-men. After many attempts at developing a cure, the infected people of Gilneas have managed to keep their mind and consciousness and have been sworn into the Alliance to battle the Forsaken threat that ravages their land.

Capital City: Gilneas City has been abandoned; the Worgen have sought refuge in the Howling Oak in Darnassus.

MUS_GilneasTown

Appearance: Worgen have two appearances--a human form and a worgen form. The features you choose for one form will affect your fur color, facial details, and other customization options! Create your character's appearance in Wowhead's Dressing Room.

Culture: Worgen cities and dress are reminiscent of an English novel--very rainy, antique, and gloomy.

The Worgen have clues ties to the Night Elves; a group of Night Elves millenia ago decided to harness the power of the Wild God Goldrinn, but couldn't control their raw power. Scythe of Elune Scythe of Elune was originally created to harness the rage of Goldrinn by pairing Goldrinn's fang with a staff blessed by Elune. This failed, and the worgen were banished to the Emerald Dream.

Years later, Velinde Starsong found and used the Scythe to fight demons in Felwood, but could not control the summoned Worgen. When traveling to Silverpine Forest to ask Arugal for help, she was attacked by Worgen and killed. The power of the Scythe then summoned even more Worgen into Duskwood from the Emerald Dream. This was a questline in vanilla which is no longer available. In Take Back What's Ours Take Back What's Ours, players must retrieve the Scythe before the Forsaken acquire it and use it to control the Worgen.

The Greymane worgen were infected after the curse spread to Gilneas. The night elves helped them find a cure to retain their sanity and refuge; the Worgen ""hub"" is now in Darnassus.

Appearance: Pandaren are quite similar to Pandas, with red and black fur options! They also come with cheerfully-colored hair streaks. Create your character's appearance in Wowhead's Dressing Room.

Culture: Pandaren, like Dwarves, are known for their love of brews--the Monk Tank specialization is called Brewmaster. You can find inhabitants of Pandaria creating brews all over the continent, notably Stormstout Brewery.

After the Mogu Empire dissolved, the Zandalari wanted to claim the land promised to them by Lei Shen - northern Kun-Lai Summit. The Pandaren, who felt no need to maintain a military, were badly outmatched until a young Pandaren, Jiang, defeated the Zandalari while fighting on a trained cloud serpent. Desperate, the Zandalari sought to resurrect Lei Shen, but Jiang sacrificed herself, killing the troll leader Mengai in the process. Jiang’s legacy was honored by preserving her teachings and passing them down in the Order of the Cloud Serpent. Players can gain reputation with Order of the Cloud Serpent to learn how to ride cloud serpents like Reins of the Golden Cloud Serpent Reins of the Golden Cloud Serpent. For this reputation grind, you help raise a hatchling to maturity and compete in races with other cloud serpent riders. This faction rewards jewelcrafting panther patterns, capturable wild serpent battle pets, pet toys, and cloud serpent mounts.

Back in the days of captivity, Kang, a young brewmaster, realized that the Mogu’s cruelty was a sign of weakness, not strength. Without servants, they were nothing. As the Pandaren were forbidden weapons, he taught himself how to fight unarmed with a unique “dancing” style relying on inner strength. lave rebellions started and the Mogu quickly crumbled without slaves to rely upon. In the final battle, both sides sustained serious losses, including Kang. This incited some Pandaren to turn to revenge, but Kang’s pupil Song reminded Pandaren about their pursuit for justice. Song became the first “lorewalker,” traveling around Pandaria to spread parables about their culture. The unique “dancing” style can be seen in the martial arts animations of the Monk class in combat. The Pandaren's values of peace and inner strength are reflected in their tranquil landscapes, Tian Monastery in The Jade Forest, and Peak of Serenity.

Overview: The Nightborne, also known as the shal'dorei are a race of elves that reside in Suramar. They have been separated from the rest of the world for thousands of years and due to the prolonged exposure to the Nightwell, an ancient power source created by the Highborne, they evolved into a unique race of elves. They were led by Elisande up until the events of The Nighthold, which resulted in Elisande's death and a step closer to the defeat of the Burning Legion. The events that had taken place in Suramar were due to an ultimatum given to them by the Burning Legion, and in order to preserve their civilization, Elisande chose to side with the army of Sargeras. With the help of forces outside the Broken Isles, The Nightfallen were able to put an end to Elisande's rule and save their people from the Nightwell's addiction.

Guild,Guild,"Guild reputation was added in Cataclysm as an incentive to promote guild loyalty and activity. There are unique perks, mounts, and pets that you can only get being part of a Guild too!

This guide covers how to gain reputation with a guild, how to level a guild up, achievements, perks for each guild level, and what reputation levels and achievements you need to unlock all the special guild rewards.
Guild Reputation
Guild reputation lets players purchase special rewards from Guild Vendors and work towards Guild Achievements.
Guild reputation can be gained by turning in quests, killing PvE bosses in a guild group, or PvPing in a guild group.
In Mists of Pandaria, the weekly cap for guild reputation you can earn per week has been removed. Between this and the limit on daily quests being lifted, you can grind reputation out pretty quickly.
You can speed up reputation gains through reputation buffs like  Diplomacy (full list here).
There are two guild tabards that increase reputation: Illustrious Guild Tabard Illustrious Guild Tabard requires Friendly and boosts guild rep gains by 50%, Renowned Guild Tabard Renowned Guild Tabard requires Honored and boosts guild rep gains by 100%.
When you join a new guild, you lose one rank of reputation. So if you were Exalted with your old guild, you'll be Revered with your new guild.
Guild Leveling
Guild levels have been removed in Warlords of Draenor--all guilds are effectively level 25. Players can still increase personal reputation in their guild, and complete activities that reward gold for the guild bank.

Misc,Free to Play guide,"A Free to Play Level 20 Guide to the best gear, enchants and toys for maximum fun.
Want to play for free, and run battlegrounds, and have fun? This isn’t easy, but, you’ll have about the best gear possible on a level 20.

Desired end state, Gnomish Engineer and any other profession. Enchanting is the first and last to choose as it requires you to disenchant a lot of BfA gear to get the enchants that actually work for your gear. Since you can make vellums, there’s no need to keep enchanting after making a handful of vellums for gear you might obtain later. Getting enough mats to make the better BfA enchants will take time, so, for a while, you’ll have Engineering/Enchanting. To make some of the cool engineering devices, you need other items from gathering or crafting professions. For some of the fun trinkets, you need the Inlaid Mithril Cylinder. In order to get that, you need to pick up mining, level engineering to 205 to make the plans, drop mining and level blacksmithing to 200 to make the Mithril Cylinder, then drop blacksmithing to pick up another profession.

Getting some of the items out of the way that you’ll need later from a gathering skill and banking it saves frustration.
Bags
The largest bag you can purchase is the 18 slot Explorer's Pack Explorer's Pack. You’ll need 11 of them to fill up your bank and backpack. You can get the 28 slot Goat's Tote Goat's Tote from a rare in BfA (100% drop rate). You can get a 26 slot bag, Addie's Ink-Stained Satchel Addie's Ink-Stained Satchel in Legion. A 24 slot bag, Grummlepack Grummlepack is available in Pandaria. Your priority will be on the backpack since you’ll be gathering a ton of mats, and saving every item that you can disenchant later. Buy the reagent slot in your bank early! The Big Bag Guide. To get the best enchants for your F2P account, you'll need to level BfA tailoring to get the enchanting mats. If you do this, at tailoring 50, you can make the 30 slot Deep Sea Bag Deep Sea Bag.
Prep statement
Some engineering items will require a lot of farming mobs to get the required items - or gems which require a lot of mining. Be prepared to drop professions and relevel them again. Between profession swaps, consider picking up enchanting so you can disenchant the gear you obtained while farming mats.

At level 20 with mostly item level 61 gear, you probably won’t need to keep alchemy. Most of the alchemy and enchanting recipes won’t work on gear with an item level over 50. Many of the newer Shadowlands recipes require your character to be level 50.
Starting out
Getting to level 20 first before leveling professions is easier with the faster mount speed obtained at level 20. Even though many of the mobs now scale, being reasonably geared will make gathering quicker.

When you first create your character, pick up Enchanting and Tailoring, make your Runed Copper Rod and disenchant anything you don’t use. If you have heirloom gear, use it. Try to quest in Kul Tiras/Zandalar once you’re able and pick up BfA Tailoring as it increases the drop rate of cloth from humanoids. Cloth gear will get scrapped, keep anything else to DE as that is the enchanting that you need to finish up your toon. Don’t spend time leveling enchanting at this point - just disenchant non-BfA items and bank what you can. Avoid disenchanting BfA items as you can use these for easy skillups later. You can use the Scrap-O-Matic 1000 to determine which gear is from BfA.

Professions: Enchanting
What is important to you?
Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector (Alchemy)
Catseye Ultra Goggles Catseye Ultra Goggles (Alchemy)
Ice Deflector Ice Deflector (Alchemy), Go for the trinket rather than this
Gnomish Death Ray Gnomish Death Ray (Blacksmithing)
Gnomish Battle Chicken Gnomish Battle Chicken (Blacksmithing)
Arcane Bomb Arcane Bomb (Alchemy, Blacksmithing)
Voice Amplification Modulator Voice Amplification Modulator (Alchemy, Blacksmithing), limited usefulness

Once you’ve hit 20, run a few dungeons to get some level 61 gear as it makes gathering much easier. At this point, you can start to hold your own in battlegrounds. You will be targeted first, but unless people are in Heirlooms, you are pretty evenly matched with someone 4-5 levels above you. Remember that you'll probably want to use Chromie Time to switch to classic for your Shoulders and Chest and possibly the helm. For the helm, you can do The Great Sea Scrolls The Great Sea Scrolls and turn it in AFTER you hit level 20 to get the level 61 helm. It requires you to loot 12-15 chests throughout Kul Tiras or Zandalar for the scrolls, and quest turnins are on the respective continents for Horde and Alliance.

Professions: Enchanting, Tailoring

Pick up Tailoring and make 20 Relic of the Past I Relic of the Past I. There are recipes that need these if you want a slightly higher itemlevel. These are really easy to make using Linen Cloth and you can make them at Level 1, so make 20 of them, just in case. You can also wait until you pick up Blacksmithing and make these at the cost of 5 copper ore per. You will get skillups, so this can help level Classic Blacksmithing. With BfA Tailoring, you can make some of the  Relic of the Past III combined with Tidespray Linen Bracers Tidespray Linen Bracers which increases the chance when scrapping to get Deep Sea Satin Deep Sea Satin.

Professions: Enchanting, Skinning

Drop tailoring and pick up Skinning. At level 20, you need to have Skinning around 100 to start getting Medium Leather (Un’Goro Crater). At 150 skill, you can skin to get Heavy Leather (Desolace). You need 17 Medium Leather and 8 Heavy leather.

Professions: Mining, Engineering, then drop Engineering for Jewelcrafting

It is strongly recommended that you keep Mining and Jewelcrafting at the same time due to the discovery and proc rate of getting the gems you need. Once you run enough instances, you’ll end up with Item Level 61 gear - some of which has sockets. Pandaria enchanting has the +2 primary stat gems. Due to the proc rate of getting the gems you need, this is a good time to have Mining/Jewelcrafting as your two professions. Since you are going after Pandarian gems, get Pandarian Engineering and make the Mist-Piercing Goggles Mist-Piercing Goggles. While you’re at it, take a few minutes to pick up Draenor Mining and Engineering and make the Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife. Drop Engineering and pick up Pandarian Jewelcrafting. Make 10-20 of the gems that you’ll want and then drop Jewelcrafting. If you PVP a lot, make a bunch of the +stamina gems in addition to your primary stat gems. Don’t spend time doing Classic Mining at this point even if you are going for the Arcane Bombs.

Pandarian Mining routes. You can mine only Ghost Iron Ore Ghost Iron Ore and it works fine. You can also mine Kyparite Kyparite in an area with mobs that are level 25 and not too difficult to handle. I did not find the increased drop rate of gems faster than mining more Ghost Iron.

 

Most likely you’ll want to focus on the Primordial Ruby recipes ( Bold Primordial Ruby,  Brilliant Primordial Ruby,  Delicate Primordial Ruby,  Flashing Primordial Ruby,  Precise Primordial Ruby) and the Solid River's Heart Solid River's Heart for the +2 Stamina. Bear in mind that the tooltip says +4, but at level 20, you only get +2. Depending on your luck, you need 25 Jewelcrafting to learn the Facet of Research for Primordial Rubies, and each 100 Ghost Iron Ore gives you roughly 3 Primordial Rubies for the research. As it would take 7 days at worst to get all of the red recipes, you might need 700 Ghost Iron Ore. Due to scaling, it isn't necessary to get the Primordial Ruby Recipes as Perfect Pandarian gems give you the same +2 primary stat as the Primordial Rubies. While the Perfect Pandarian gems require cutting a number of gems, between the two, you can make a decent set of gems for the future. The normal cuts give you +1, except for the +1 primary/+1 secondary gems. If you kill enough rares, you can get the Primal Diamond recipe which gives you the ability to make a Fleet Primal Diamond (another world drop) which gives +speed and stacks with the next gem. The Kul Tiran/Zandalar gems require itemlevel 50 - and you'll have plenty of itemlevel 61 gear. One interesting gem is Straddling Viridium Straddling Viridium which is Unique Equipped and results in +8 at level 20, or roughly 7% run speed.

Depending on how much instancing you do, you do have the chance to get an epic itemlevel 87 in instances. If you get lucky enough to get an epic drop like that with a socket, you can use Shadowlands gems which require itemlevel 87. If you intend to instance frequently, you might want to make a few of the Jewel Clusters. You can always drop something and mine to get Shadowland gems as the interesting gems are not discoveries and can be learned fairly early on.
Decision time.
I need the Arcane Bomb Arcane Bomb! (or Catseye Ultra Goggles or Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector) Bear in mind the Arcane Bomb is a world drop and might take time. If you intend to make them, making the Arcanite bars while you have Alchemy saves you from having to level alchemy later to make the bars when you don’t have Herbalism and Alchemy at the same time.

Professions: Herbalism, Alchemy

If you want the Arcane Bomb Arcane Bomb - which in the 20-29 bracket is about ⅓ of a player’s mana, you need Alchemy. If you are going after Alchemy, drop your current professions and pick up Herbalism/Alchemy. Level alchemy to 275 so you can transmute Thorium into Arcanite. You’ll want to make a lot of Arcanite Bars (Thorium). For the Catseye Ultra Googles and Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector, you also need Catseye Elixir Catseye Elixir and Frost Oil Frost Oil. Since you’re a level 20 in a bracket with level 29s, the Catseye Ultra Goggles help quite a bit. It looks like the drop rate for the Arcane Bomb is limited to instances you would need to join with someone with a paid account.

For engineering you’ll need to collect 40 Purple Lotus and 24 Nagrand Arrowbloom and 4 Icecap. Pick some extra, just in case.

Professions: Mining, Alchemy

Drop Herbalism and pick up Mining so that you can make a handful of the Arcanite Bar Arcanite Bar. Keep the ore as you’ll need it for Engineering and Blacksmithing. Make note of the materials you’ll need for Blacksmithing in the next section if you are going to do both.

For Thorium, Silithis (make sure you timewalk back to pre-Cataclysm) or Winterspring are the best locations for the Arcane Crystal Arcane Crystal. Because you make 3 Arcane Bombs per Arcane Crystal and you need to level to 275 Alchemy to do the transmutes, spending time now to build a stockpile of the Arcane bombs is worth it. You can always relevel Alchemy to make more Arcanite bars later on. It wasn't until about mining 80 that Arcane Crystals started being looted for me.
The End Grind
Professions: Mining, Engineering

In order to get the Gnomish Death Ray, you need an Inlaid Mithril Cylinder Inlaid Mithril Cylinder. If you don’t want this trinket, you can skip Blacksmithing which makes things a lot easier. In fact, you’re not required to level Classic Engineering too quickly which saves a lot of time. The most useful items are tinkers that you can get relatively quickly. The trinkets are situationally useful and fun but aren’t a must-have since the stats on these are much lower than trinkets gained through instancing.

I’ve got to have the Gnomish Death Ray Gnomish Death Ray!

To get the Gnomish Death Ray, you need the Inlaid Mithril Cylinder Inlaid Mithril Cylinder. To get that, you need to level Classic Engineering to 205 to create Plans: Inlaid Mithril Cylinder Plans: Inlaid Mithril Cylinder. You then need to level Classic Blacksmithing to level 200, learn the recipe, then create the Cylinder. With additional Inlaid Mithril Cylinders, you can make the Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan (1), Gnomish Battle Chicken (2), and the Firework Launcher (1 per Launcher). You might as well make at least four - more if you intend to make multiple Firework Launchers.

Professions: Blacksmithing, Engineering (you’ll keep this permanently)

Once you’ve made the Inlaid Mithril Cylinders, you can drop Blacksmithing and pick up Mining again. Since you will want other Engineering items from other expansions, you will need to do more mining.

Blacksmithing guide

150x Rough Stone
150x Copper Bar
95x Coarse Stone
5x Silver Bar
140x Bronze Bar
105x Heavy Stone
5x Gold Bar
230x Iron Bar
35x Green Dye - Sold by Tailoring and Leatherworking supply vendors
50x Steel Bar

Before you drop mining, if you intend to get the Arcanite bars, mine enough Thorium and Arcane Crystals. Remember that each Arcane Crystal (and the appropriate Thorium which you’ll have plenty of) makes 3 Arcane Bombs.

Consider if you want to level BfA Blacksmithing to create Monel-Hardened Hoofplates Monel-Hardened Hoofplates (50 Blacksmithing), which can later be converted by Enchanting to Light-Step Hoofplates Light-Step Hoofplates (165 Enchanting). It takes roughly 775 Monelite Ore to level Blacksmithing to make the Monel-Hardened Hoofplates Monel-Hardened Hoofplates.

Professions: Mining, Engineering

If you decide not to get the Gnomish Death Ray, you can go after various Engineering that makes the most sense. In order to get the Northrend Nitro Boosts, you need a Gyromatic Micro-Adjustor Gyromatic Micro-Adjustor which requires Classic Engineering 175… or, you could make a Draenor Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife at level 1. Focus on getting the Pandaria Goblin Glider and the Northrend Nitro Boosts as those are the most useful tinkers. You can use the Northrend Flexweave underlay for your cloak until you can get the Pandaria Goblin Glider as well. Most of the other tinkers are situationally nice - having separate belts available that you can swap makes it simple. You might want the Cataclysm Invisibility Field on one belt if you don’t have the ability to stealth. The Northrend Frag Belt is also quite handy for a 3 second AOE stun.

Cloak tinkers - Pandaria:  Goblin Glider (25), Northrend:  Flexweave Underlay (5)
Belt tinkers - Kul Tiran:  Holographic Horror Projector (85),  Miniaturized Plasma Shield (85),  Belt Enchant: Personal Space Amplifier (85), Pandaria:  Watergliding Jets (25), Cataclysm:  Grounded Plasma Shield (1),  Invisibility Field(1),  Spinal Healing Injector (1), Northrend:  Mind Amplification Dish (35),  Nitro Boosts (30),  EMP Generator (15),  Frag Belt (1)

If you just want to get the Northrend Nitro Boosts, you need to mine 260 Cobalt Ore. While mining that, you should get the 25 Crystallized Water and 10 Crystallized Earth you need.

Bear in mind, Engineering also gives you some cool devices that you will want to make very early as you start mining. Pandarian Engineering has the Mist-Piercing Goggles Mist-Piercing Goggles which help you see additional mining nodes. The Cataclysm Engineering Electrostatic Condenser Electrostatic Condenser helps find Volatile Air which you will need to level if you want the Gnomish Gravity Well Gnomish Gravity Well. The Gravity Well comes in handy during some PVE questing - if you want to level Pandarian Farming or to turn in the Archaeology items in Pandaria.

Professions: Engineering/Enchanting

At this point, obtain Enchanting and level BfA enchanting until you get enough vellums to enchant your rings and weapons.
Final notes
You're mostly geared with the best items you can get. Hopefully you've run some battlegrounds and over time, as you level Engineering, you'll open up a few more trinkets that are fun. Farming for the Arcane Bomb recipe takes a bit but that is a huge surprise in 20-29 battlegrounds to the enemy players. Fine tuning, running instances to get the last few pieces of gear, starting to optimize your stat priority with replacement gear takes place and over time, you'll have your Best in Slot gear, with the best enchants you can get, and the best gems. Focus on having a PVP and Instancing set - having more stamina can make a difference in battlegrounds - and with the rest of your gear, you'll have the DPS output to hold your own.

Good Luck!"
Guild,Social Communication,"World of Warcraft is an Massively Multiplayer Online game. Many of the activities in-game are enhanced by doing them with friends! From completing a quest together to finding four other players to complete a challenging dungeon for better loot, World of Warcraft is a social experience. This guide explains how to make the most of your social experience in WoW.
Talking to Players
You can chat to players in game privately using whispers. All messages with players will show up by default at the bottom-left of your screen.

To whisper someone, hit the ""Return"" key, type ""/tell"" and then the name of the player. You can then type a message privately to that player. When you hit ""Return"" again, they will see the message. If you are already in a conversation with that person, you can just click on their name in the chat log and type your message back.

You can also communicate through says or yells. Avoid yelling because everyone in the zone will hear you. Whispers display as light pink, says are white, and yells are red.
hello.png
Emotes
Another way of communicating with players is emotes. Instead of typing a sentence, you can type in a phrase and your in-game character will express that feeling through an animation and sound byte. For example, /cheer will have your character jump in the air and sound happy.

This sort of interaction is not private like whispers; nearby players can see your emotes (and decide to join in). Emotes are also required for some fun achievements, like To All The Squirrels I've Loved Before To All The Squirrels I've Loved Before.

Some popular emotes include: /bow, /greet, /highfive, /cheer, /silly, /smile
emote message.png


There are numerous emotes and Wowhead user Ozlem has made a series of guides highlighting each type of emote:
Happy, Polite, Friendly & Affectionate Emotes.
Neutral, Unhappy & Despondent Emotes.
Taunts, Hostile & Combat Emotes.
Reactions, Miscellaneous & Custom Emotes.
Creating A Party
You can form a party of up to 5 players in game. Parties are good if you need help completing an objective or need to meet up with a player:
If you are interested in running a dungeon and need a few more players, your party can queue up as a group.
You can see the location of other party members on the map.
By typing /party you can talk only to your group members. This chat will be light blue.
To form a party, either right-click on a player and hit the Invite option, or type /invite <playername> into chat. Only the leader of a party can invite.
party message.png
Chat Channels and Tabs
You can join public chat channels in various zones, or set up a group chat with your friends in-game.

To join a channel, type ""/join <name>."" You will either join an existing channel with that name, or if there is no channel, start a new channel. Text from this channel will be in beige.

The default chat channels are:
General
Trade
LocalDefense
LookingForGroup
To leave a channel, type ""/leave <name>""

To manage the chat channels click the icon in the chat below ""Social"". You can see who belongs to each general channel, and hit the ""Add"" button to create your own chat channel. It can even be password protected.
chatmessage.png
Player Interactions
When you right-click on a player's name, a menu pops up with a number of options. Here's an overview.
Invite: invite a player to your party
Whisper: Lets you privately message a player
Inspect: Open up a character's gear profile so you can check out their gear
Compare Achievements: See how many in-game accomplishments you both have
Trade: Open a window with another player to give or receive items and gold
Follow: Need to step away from your computer for a minute? Put a friend on auto-follow if they are going to the same place
Duel: See which player is stronger in combat
Pet-Battle Duel: If you decide to collect pets later in the game, you can challenge a player's team of pets to combat
Friends List
If you enjoy interacting with someone, you can add them as a friend. The next time both of you are in-game at the same time, you can easily get in touch and plan something to do.

You can add someone to your friends list two ways: via their character name, or their Battle.net name.
If you add someone’s character name, you are only notified when that particular character logs onto WoW.
If you add someone’s Battle.tag, you'll know when they're online on any World of Warcraft character, or playing any other Blizzard game.
friends message.png

To add someone to your friends list:
In game, hit the letter ""O"".
Hit the red Add Friend button at the bottom left of your list, and then type in the character's name or Battle.tag.
Your friends list allows you to do the following:
Message a friend by highlighting their name and clicking on ""Send Message.""
Adding online friends to a group via the + icon to the right of their name. Be polite and ask first before doing so!
See what Blizzard games all of your Battletag friends are playing.
The Pending tab shows all of your own friend requests.
The speech bubble option at the top right allows you to set a status message. Looking for help? Set a status message asking for assistance and see if any friends reply.
Set your status to available (green), yellow (away), or red (busy), using the dropdown menu at the top right.
Right-click on a friend's name to bring up more options, such as setting a note so you remember details about your new friend, and viewing their friends so you can see if you share any acquaintances.
The ignore tab brings up all of the players you have muted. You will not see messages from these people.
Your Friends LIst comes with several other tabs:
The ""Who"" tab lets you query the names of players in a certain zone or guild. This is helpful if you are looking for assistance in an area, or want to join a guild and need to speak to an officer.
The chat tab brings up a list of chat channels you belong to, which is discussed below in more detail. There are several default ones you can belong to, like Trade Chat in a city, and you can also create your own custom channels to have small group conversations with friends.
The Raid tab is inactive unless you join a very large group at higher levels.
If you play other Blizzard games, you may be interested in setting up a Battletag and using the Battle.net-wide friends list. Here is a link to get the Battle.net App.
Single Sign-On: Log in once to access Blizzard games, and stay logged in for up to 30 days.

Install and Auto-Update Games: Install games directly through the app and, if you choose to leave the app running on your desktop, keep them up-to-date automatically even while you’re away from your computer.

Get the Latest News: The app serves as a central hub to find the latest Blizzard game information, developer blogs, and more. Filter news based on which games you play, and get breaking updates before you enter Azeroth, Sanctuary, or the Koprulu sector.
On the Battle.net App, you can see which of your friends is playing any Blizzard game. You can even message them if they're not playing the same game.

When you sign up for the Battle.net App, you will be prompted to create a Battle.tag. This is a name that your friends will see when you play any game. If a friend has a Battletag, they can tell when you play any character in WoW, not just one with a specific name.

From Blizzard's Battletag blog:
A BattleTag™ is a player-chosen nickname that identifies your Battle.net account in our games, websites, community forums, and more. Only one BattleTag can be associated with a Battle.net account.

BattleTag friends are not available cross-region. You must add friends to each region’s friend list when you log in for the first time.

BattleTags do not need to be unique. You can use any name you want, as long as it follows our Naming Policy. Each BattleTag is assigned a numeric ID to create a unique identifier (for example, FallenSlayer#3592).

To change your BattleTag, log in to Battle.net Account Management, go to the Summary page, and click Change in the BattleTag section.
Guild Information
The best way to ensure you are surrounded by like-minded friendly players is to find a guild which suits your needs. A guild is an extended social network, where you can easily talk to other members and see who is available online. Members of your guild can help you with group challenges, items to wear, and general assistance.
guild finder.png


As your guild completes milestones together, you can even purchase special rewards like Reins of the Dark Phoenix Reins of the Dark Phoenix and Reins of the Thundering Jade Cloud Serpent Reins of the Thundering Jade Cloud Serpent. Learn more in our Guild Rewards Guide.

Finding the right guild is important. Some players may spam you with guild invites when they see you are unguilded. You don't have to accept the first guild you find! Here are some ways to find a good guild:
Use Blizzard's in-game Guid Finder tool. To open this tool up, hit ""J"" in game.
On the Guild Finder page, you will be prompted to fill in some information about your playstyle:
Guild Interests: Questing (leveling), Dungeons (group content), Raids (higher-level group content), PvP, and Role Playing
Availability: Weekdays and/or Weekends
Class Roles: Tank, Healer, or Damage.
You can also leave any additional comments.
Once you have submitted a guild query, interested guilds can leave invitations in the Requests tab in the Guild Finder.
You can see a list of guilds in the ""Browse"" tab. Mouse over each guild to see their interests and number of members online. While it's better to do more guild research before asking to join, you can hit ""Request Membership"" if it looks like a good fit.
You can also check the Guild Recruitment Forums on the official World of Warcraft site, or read channels like the Guild Recruitment Channel in game.
If you find a guild that seems interesting, check out their website and try to talk members of the guild, either online or on their website.
To get an invitation to a guild, log online and message the officer of a guild for an invite. It is poor etiquette to message about an invite before speaking to an officer. You may be ignored.
There are many types of guilds, here are a few things to keep in mind so you find one that's a good fit:
Active users: Find a guild that has lots of players who enjoy logging on frequently!
Size: Some players prefer a guild with a handful of players they can know personally, others want to be part of a larger community where there's always someone online to help out.
Activities: Guilds specialize in different things, based on the interests of the officers. Some guilds are designed to be social or help other players level. Other guilds focus on advanced max-level activities, such as raiding.
Reputation: Similar to real-life organizations, guilds build up their reputation based on the actions of their users. Look for guilds that are friendly and are known for being stable and reliable.
Once you are part of a guild, be courteous and helpful! You will see guild chat appear in your chat box in green text. You can send message to everyone in guild by typing /g <message>."
General,Glossary,"Term	Meaning
Aggro	Akin to threat, ""aggro"" refers to the moment when threat reaches the threshold necessary for the mob to attack you.
Alts	This stands for ""alternate,"" as in alternate characters. People who have more than one character call their main one a ""main"" and any alternate characters ""alts.""
BC	Burning Crusade (expansion).
Burning Legion	Lead by fallen titan Sargeras, the Burning Legion is the evil force (think demons) behind Burning Crusade and Legion in particular, but also features heavily in Warlords of Draenor and to a much smaller extent WotLK.
Belf	Blood elf
Bubble hearth	An enchantment on bracers that allows hearthing while invulnerable.
Cata	Cataclysm (expansion).
Classic	The re-release of the original World of Warcraft game before the first expansion Burning Crusade (as distinct from ""Vanilla,"" which Classic emulates).
Clothie	A character that wears cloth; mages, priests, warlocks, and so forth.
Closet	A warlock can summon party members with what is called a warlock closet.
Cooldown	When you use a spell it is then said to be “on cooldown” until you can use it again. You can set the game to show a number in the spell's box counting down until it's available.
Cow	A semi-derogatory, semi-affectionate term for tauren of any stripe. Indeed, all tauren can type /moo to actually moo.
Don't Stand In The Fire!	Stop killing yourself ... usually by standing in fire or some other vile substance on the ground.
Drinking	Chances are, the person is not sharing their inebriation status with you if they say this during combat; rather, they are drinking a potion so they can get more mana to heal your butt.
DOT	Damage Over Time. These spells and effects do damage every second.
DPS	Damage Per Second.
EFC	""Enemy carrier of YOUR flag,"" not the flag carrier of the enemy's flag.
FP	Flight path.
Hearth	To use your hearthstone.
Hero class	There are technically two hero classes, which were actual new races with their own class. The first were Death Knights that came as part of the assault on the former master the Lich King, and the second hero class appeared with Legion, the Illidari, who were followers of Illidan in his battle to fight the Burning Legion and keep them from taking Azeroth and destroying it. You need a character of at least 55 to be able to start a DK and you need a level 98 character to be able to start an Illidari. In any case, the term isn't used for that massive body of land that no longer exists anymore, so confusion potential is naught.
HOT	Heal over time. These spells heal you for a bit each second.
HPS	Healing Per Second.
Kalimdor	“For Kalimdor!” is akin to ""For Pangea!"" only we didn't live on Pangea as a race, whereas all but orcs did live on the pre-sundering continent of Kalimdor. The west-most continent retained the name after The Sundering.
Khaz Modan	The dwarves often refer to this location, but it's not one per se, it's a region including Aerie Peaks north to Grim Batol, west to Wetlands, east to Twilight Highlands, and south to Loch Modan.
Legion	Expansion (as distinct from the Burning Legion demonic forces).
LFG	Looking for group.
LFM	Looking for more.
Lordaeron	A region encompassing Tirisfal Glades, Eastern and Western Plaguelands (before the plague), Silverpine Forest, Gilneas, Dalaran (when it was in the ground it was in Hillsbarad Foothills), Hillsbarad Foothills itself, and Arathi Highlands.
LOS	""Line of sight."" If there is a wall between you and your healer, you can't be healed. If there is a wall between you and your enemy, you can't cast most spells on it because they are out of sight.
Main	Your currently focused character that you play constantly or a character you cherish above all others.
Mob/Mobs	Enemy or enemies. Because they usually mob you, the term’s origination isn’t hard to assess.
MoP	Mists of Pandaria (expansion).
Nelf	Night elf.
Nerf (as in “to nerf”)	Nerfing means to make something less punishing somehow, just like a Nerf football doesn’t hurt when you get hit in the face with it compared to a real pigskin.
Ninja	In the modern game, this basically means to steal a base while in stealth.
OOM	Out of mana.
Org	Short for Orgrimmar, the Horde capital in Durotar.
Proc	Originally the term probably stems from ""processes,"" but what you should read it as is ""activates"" in verb form or as another name for the effect itself when used as a noun. Verb usage: ""This trinket procs Timewalk."" Use X trinket to proc whatever proc."" Yes, you see that you can confusingly use ""proc"" as the verb and a noun, but what it means is "" Use trinket X to activate Y effect, and that actually does make sense.
Quel-Thalas	A region including Ghostlands, Eversong Woods, Silvermoon City, the nearby Blood Elf starter zone, and the Isle of Quel-Danas. Also refers to an unused zone that at some point may be folded into the Plaguelands, somehow, because it is and remains an unfinished zone accessible only via traveling east on the northern coast of Tirisfal Glades. Because the zone is so small and because Stratholme used to be a port city, chances are that region may go to that city at some point, as it wasn't large enough for what they wanted to do with it as was evident when they didn't use the zone but instead started over with the other zones that are now considered part of what was Quel-Thalas before WotLK.
Roll	As in ""I want to roll a priest."" In Dungeons & Dragons as well as other genuine role-playing games in which you had to roll dice to determine your traits, these dice that are absolutely not used in WoW are what is being referred to. In early video game RPGs, you would still have to click a Roll button to roll your stats, and could roll over and over again until you got lucky and got a good roll. This is not the case in WoW, so people who say this are just trying to sound ""old school.""
Rotation	The buttons that you press in combat. You might hit ""1"" when entering combat and then another key, and so forth, each time.
Squishy	To be ""squishy"" means to look at your health bar when someone, even you, are trying to heal yourself and just cannot get to 50 percent, much less higher, most of the time. If you're always near death, you're ""squishy"" as far as your healer is concerned.
SW	Stormwind, capital city of the Alliance.
Threat	When you get near an enemy, you generate threat. Related to aggro.
Toon	A name for character probably stemming from the word “cartoon.”
Troll	Someone who just wants to harass others or start a fight in chat, be it in a major city like Org or SW, or in a PvP battleground, or wherever.
Velf	Void elf.
WoD	Warlords of Draenor (expansion).
WotLK	See Wrath.
Wrath	Wrath of the Lich King (expansion).
Zerg	Actually a creature type in StarCraft, this “zerg” means to rush forward with no thought to what is on your sides or behind you. If someone says “zerg x,” they mean everyone should rush to (and if possible fight) whatever X is.

Starting point for less experienced WoW players looking to create a character, noting major decisions that are made early on to reduce d'oh moments later, explaining some of the basic mechanics of the game, and citing a few tips about the user interface and other small details that tend to get overlooked, but are really helpful in starting out. Basically, a culmination of all the things I wish I had known when I first started to play WoW.
Planning Your Character
When you start a new character, there are several decisions to make surrounding the direction in which you want to take it.
Class
Tip: You can change everything about your character later (by paying a fee), but you cannot change your class. So, this is probably the most important decision you'll make.
The class you select depends entirely on which role you want to perform. In a ""battle"" situation, these are the three roles to fill for everyone to survive--tank, healer, and damage dealers:
Role	Purpose
Healer	Heals the hurt, especially the tank (if the tank dies, everyone dies).
Tank	Focuses the mob on them, grabbing their attention using well-timed aggro methods and sustaining the majority of the damage.
Damage Dealer	Damages the mob, delivering it either through melee (in-your-face fighting) or casting (sending spells from a distance). The damage, regardless of its delivery method, can can either be immediate or ""damage over time"" (otherwise known as ""DOTs""). When first starting out and getting your feet wet, this is generally an easy class to play, as healers and tanks are a bit more specialized.
Now that you know what the roles are, you can review each class in detail to understand the benefits of each and which will support the role you want, as well as consider how your choice of class will affect the professions you choose to do (more on that later).

Keep in mind:
Leveling your character. In the beginning, your character spends most of its time questing and leveling, which basically involves killing and looting a lot of things. Leveling your character alone is harder to do as a ""clothy"" (such as Priest or Mage) or leatherwearer (such as Druid or Rogue) than it is as a character who can eventually wear mail (Hunter or Shaman, at level 40) or plate (such as a Warrior or Paladin). On the other hand, most clothies and leatherwearers can both heal themselves and do damage, making them a little more self-sufficient for leveling.
Not every class can perform every role. This means that you cannot play a Warrior and expect to be a healer, too. But several classes can perform more than one role—in fact, some characters, like Druids and Paladins, can do all three roles!
Some roles are more challenging than others. Healing and tanking can be stressful, requiring a lot of tactical knowledge and perfect timing, with everyone's ""lives"" in your hands. DPS is generally less challenging, but can be very involved, depending on the situation. At times, it requires multitasking, paying close attention to what's going on around you, so you can stay healthy so the healer can focus on the tank (common sense things, like, don't stand in a fire or be too near the mob when it's spraying poison everywhere), keep ""adds"" away from the healer so the healer doesn't die (if the healer dies, the tank dies, then everyone else dies), and assist with helping those who cannot help themselves (like freeing others from immobilizing webs).
Ease of getting into raids and dungeons. Because healing and tanking are more challenging, fewer people choose to play them. This means that if you want to do a lot of raiding and dungeons, you generally will have to wait for less time than a DPS character to get in. I find that healers, especially, are sought after.
PVP versus PVE. For someone like me, I focus on player versus environment (PVE) for the most part. I do not like player versus player (PVP). If you want to do PVP, though, this may also factor into your decision for what class to be and the role you wish to play.
Tip: In the end, if you really can't decide or want to focus on more than one role, you can do Dual Talent Specialization at Level 30.
Glyphs and Talents
As you progress in the game, you will be able to fill your talent tree and glyph table. It's best to consult experienced class players and do research to find out what combinations work best for what role you wish to play. Aside from your gear, your choices in this area are the most deciding factor in your efficiency and effectiveness in your role.
Faction
Now that you know what role you want to play, you can start to build your character. First you must decide if you want to play Horde or Alliance, which are the two main factions in the game.

It is less of a choice between ""good"" and ""bad,"" and more of a choice between:
Alliance - Fanciful, attractive, ""normal"" characters with angelic, clean appearances (like Humans!)
Horde - Gruesome, less traditional characters with missing jaws and grotesquely colored skin with bones poking out (like undead Humans!)
Since more attractive races (like Blood Elves) have been added to the Horde side, in the end, it's really just about your preference for the design of the available races in each and their respective leveling areas, and how each race combines with their available classes (not all races can play every class).
Race
Just as every class cannot perform every role, every race cannot play every class. This means that if you want to play a Night Elf, but you also want to be a Shaman, you must eventually choose between being a Shaman or being a Night Elf because you cannot be both. Sometimes a desire to play a particular race dictates your class choice; however, I think it is most typical for people to choose their class first, then select which race to be within that parameter.

Also, some classes just lend themselves to a particular race; for example, Trolls make good hunters because of a Bow Specialization ability they have innately. So, it's good to look over the abilities each race is ""born"" with to see how that might coincide with your plans.
Naming Your Character
Odds are, the name you want will be taken. If this is the case, these are the tactics I use to try to still get the name I want, even if it isn't what I originally envisioned:
Add an extra character to the end or the beginning
Create an anagram
Try a different language (baby name websites are very handy for this!)
Use wikipedia to find a nuance to name your character after
Spell it phonetically
Take out the vowels
And then here are some examples from my characters:
Nareendi - Anagram of ""Draenei"" with an extra ""n.""
Dayoodin - This character's original name was ""Deudan,"" an anagram of ""undead,"" but everyone kept pronouncing it wrong, so I changed it to the phonetic spelling of ""Dayoodin""
Schattena - I'd heard a long time ago that ""Schatten"" is German for ""shadow."" I wanted my shadow priest to have this name, but it was taken, so I just added an extra ""a"" at the end.
Hexa - I originally wanted ""Hexe,"" which was taken, so I changed the last ""e"" to an ""a""! It wasn't taken, and I ended up liking it better than the original name I wanted.
Rmplstltskn - I wanted a Goblin Warlock named ""Rumpelstiltskin,"" but that name is too long, so I just took out the vowels.
Crepuscular - This word describes animals that are active at twilight. I gave it to my Druid as her name because she turns into a bat when she flies. (I know, I am a super ultra nerd.)
Choosing Professions
When you are level 5, you will be able to choose your professions. While your character is out and about questing, you can work on these professions, which can be handy in several ways:
Make your own food, clothing, gems, mounts, potions, bandages, and other items
Make money by selling items on the Auction House
Garner achievements and titles
Garner special skills, abilities, and resistances
There are primary, secondary, and tertiary professions.
Primary
With the primary professions, you can only pick two. It is important to think this through thoroughly because, even though you can change professions later, it is a lot of work and very time-consuming because you must go back to Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms and raise your professions from 0—it is like leveling your character all over again.

Ideally, you want:
The output from one profession to work as the input for the other. This simply means that I am not going to choose Herbalism as one profession and Leatherworking as the other--it would make more sense to choose Skinning and Leatherworking because then you have one gathering profession (Skinning) which works as the input for the crafting profession (Leatherworking).
To find an advantage to using a certain profession with your race or class. Choose professions that make sense for them to do because it gives you an advantage; for example, as a leather wearer, Leatherworking can be a good choice because you can make some of your own clothing. Or, if you are a Hunter, Skinning is good because, as you progress, you can not only make clothing for yourself, you earn a Master of Anatomy ability that increases your critical strike chance, which is handy for bow users—so much the better if you are a Troll, who, as I mentioned earlier, is ""born"" with an innate Bow Specialization trait. And, some races have an affinity for a particular profession; for example, Draenei are ""born"" with an innate Gem Cutting ability so doing Jewelcrafting makes sense and Tauren are ""born"" with a Cultivation ability which makes herbalism a natural for them.
To pick professions that are not unattainable for your play level. Some primary professions are easy because they are simple gathering professions that fit nicely with other primary professions; these are: Skinning, Herbalism, and Mining. Other primary professions, like Leatherworking, Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Inscription require the output from these gathering professions, as well as more time and gold, but they are not overly challenging. The remaining primary professions (Enchanting, Engineering, Jewelcrafting, Tailoring) are more advanced, requiring more gold, planning, and patience, but also output from the gathering and less-involved crafting professions and even a reliance on others players to gain experience. These latter professions do not make very good starter professions and work best if you have a lot of gold or you have other high-level, established characters who can help you provide output from other professions. For example, while you can get jewels or metals from Mining, you can't cut the jewels into what you need for enchanting unless you also have Jewelcrafting, nor can you melt the metal into the rods or bars you need unless you also have Blacksmithing. So, it really takes three professions to be a jewelcrafter, but you can only select two--this is where it helps to have another character who might be a miner or a blacksmith (or a guild that can help you out).

Secondary
Secondary professions are less involved. And, unlike, the primary professions, you can do as many as you want, rather than picking only a couple.

I tend to train them all from the get-go so I don't have to play catch-up later, as I'd rather dig up fossils, fish, cook while I'm already questing in an area where the lakes have the level of fish I need, the mobs drop the cloth and meat I need, and the ground has the items I need to dig up. This is vastly preferable to returning to all the low-level lands as an 85 grinding and killing mobs for their drops or paying insane prices on the Auction House for supplies when you get too bored to collect them yourself. If you want to focus on achievement points, it's especially important to train for all of these right away and do them as you go along or it will be very painful later.
Tertiary
Sometimes primary professions have a tertiary skill associated with them; for example, with Inscription, you might have Herbalism as your second primary profession (going with the tip of making one profession's output be input for the other), but you will also learn how to mill herbs as a part of Inscription, just as you learn to cut gems in Jewelcrafting and cure hides in Leatherworking. These are passive and nothing that you train for specifically.
Setting Up Your User Interface
You don't have to download a bunch of fancy add-ons to make your interface work for you. I still find all that intimidating and I've been playing for years. Here are a few simple user interface changes I made, though, to help a bit--all but one of these are all done directly in the WoW UI without downloading an add-on. To get to the interface menu, I press ESC and click Interface in the list that appears, though there may be other methods.
Toolbars and Key Bindings
The WoW interface comes with several toolbars for the middle and left and right sides (all under Interface > ActionBars). However, I found this was not enough, so the only add-on I have is one that allows me to have more toolbars than are available by default. Along with these, key bindings (press ESC and click Key Bindings) are an important way to create mindless efficiency.

WoW has some default key bindings that are helpful in pulling up information about your character. These are all available in the lower right of the toolbar near your bag information. By pressing one letter, you can pull up your character information, your list of quests, your bags, and more! Run your mouse over each to see what letter to use. One that isn't listed that might be useful is that to see your friends, open your friends list by typing the letter O.
Map
If it isn't done for you by default, zoom out on the map in the upper left all the way, so that you can see the biggest area possible. This is especially helpful with trying to perform gathering professions or as a hunter to see mobs. At this time, you can also make sure your map is ""showing"" the things you want to see (such as where a bank is or where the nearest herbs are).
Information Windows
There are chat-type information windows that appear by default on your screen: General and Combat Log. The general one is pretty much a chat window and the combat log is a ""what happened"" window that gives you specific details of fights, including what happened to you, what happened to others, what you did to others, and more. I stack these on top of one another, instead of leaving them in the default tab state. It takes up more UI space, but I can see them both at once, which is more important to me and not too distracting if I make them transparent. You can change the colors, transparency, and all sorts of details to make them as useful to you as possible.
Tip: With regard to interacting with other characters, you do this in the General window. This can be both fun or bothersome:
Fun. You can do some RP, if you want, such as typing /hug or /highfive or /dance—the options are endless! I don't do it too much, but if someone helps me defeat a mob or rezzes me after I died in a dungeon, I do a /thank. Just like in real life, small things like that make a big difference in interacting with people!
Bothersome. If someone is pestering you with whispers while you're out questing or yelling profanities in a large city, you can always /ignore their character. This way, anything they ""say"" will never appear in your chat window again. (On the flip side, if you find someone fun and want to be friends with them, you can do a /friend!)
Titles and Names
You can turn off the titles for NPCs, other characters, and their pets. This can be helpful if you feel your screen is too cluttered with extraneous information. For example, I don't feel it's necessary when I'm walking through Elwynn Forest to have all the level 1 squirrels labeled as such. You can do all this under Interface > Names.
Miscellaneous Tips
Read Quest Text
It can be tempting to just grab a quest and go, but it's helpful to actually read the quest text, as it often contains important instructions regarding where something might be or how to complete it successfully. If you ever get frustrated because it seems like there's a ""bug"" in a quest, first stop and read the quest text thoroughly to make sure you aren't missing an element.
Tip: By reading the quest text, you can also learn the lore of the game, which can be fun and interesting, as well as help with an understanding of why things are the way they are.
Autoloot
Autoloot is your friend—be sure to turn it on! Select the Auto Loot checkbox under Interface > Controls.
Funding Your Character
I use ""older"" characters to purchase and send larger bags to my new character so they have more room for items while questing, as well as to send a little gold (50G lasts a while for new characters) to assist with training and such.

If you don't have older characters, don't fret. The game makes sure you at least get enough money from quest rewards and looting (always loot your kills—not only do you get money but they might drop an item that starts a new quest line that you would otherwise miss!) to be able to do your training and professions and to be able to do riding when it's time for that. To earn extra, along with normal gray and white drops that you can sell at any vendor, be sure to auction any green or blue drops you get that you can't use that are ""bind when equipped"" in the Auction House, as well as any output from your professions. The things that may have to wait are usually just superficial, like fancy gear you can buy at the Auction House, frivolities like companion pets, and, later, epic cold weather flying—all of which you'll earn in time, but you can't expect to have right away.
Training
The game is very obvious about it when it's time to train a new ability—like talent points, it tells you in the UI when you level up if there are any new spells you can get from your trainer.
Gear
I alluded earlier to the fact that some characters can wear cloth, others plate, still others leather. What is important to know here is that there are varying types of plate, varying types of cloth, varying types of mail, etc. This means that just because a piece is mail does not mean it is best for your Shaman, as it may contain stats that are meant for a Hunter. Similarly, just because a piece is cloth, it doesn't mean that it's meant for a Priest—it might be better for a Mage.
Tip: Pay attention to any armor proficiencies you gain; for example, when a Shaman hits level 40, they can wear mail instead of just cloth or leather, which greatly reduces squishiness.
Guild
If you don't already have a guild, you can keep an eye out for guild invitations, making sure that your goals for the game coincide with the guild's goals (for example, don't join a raiding guild if you don't want raiding to be your main focus in the game).
Tip: Sometimes an easy way to earn gold, especially if you are just starting out and have no higher-level characters to fund you, is if you are in a large city and someone is asking for people to sign their guild charter for 5 or 10 gold. If you are guildless, you can sign the charter, get the gold, then /gquit (sometimes you won't have a choice and they'll kick you out because they have specific plans for the guild).
Leveling
The more characters you make, the more you'll become acquainted with how it works. You start in the super newb-newb area (until about level 3), then go to the newb-newb area (level 5 or so), then the newb area (level 10 or so), and then you are released into the wide world on your own! Typically what happens is: You get a quest where you kill a bunch of things, then you get a quest to kill a smaller bunch of similar-but-tougher things, then you get a quest to kill the leader of those bunches of things and then the quest chain ends and you get a piece of gear. The quest chain you do to get The Green Hills of Stranglethorn is a perfect example of this.
Tip: While leveling, do all the quests in an area to earn the questing achievement for it and also complete the map of the area to get that achievement. The more of that you do now, the less you have to do later when you are ""grown-up""! (I am big into killing two or more birds with one stone in this game, if I can.)
Conclusion
Obviously, there are a lot of other game nuances I have not gone over here, especially given all of the patches that have gone in since I wrote this 10 years ago (it's 2022 now) and all the confusing re-releasings of everything, but in general these are the very basics that will get you started on the right foot."
