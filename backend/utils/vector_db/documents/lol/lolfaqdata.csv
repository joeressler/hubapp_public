General,Quickplay Mode Guide,"WHAT IS QUICKPLAY?
Quickplay is a new game mode on Summoner's Rift that's replacing Blind Pick. It allows you to pre-pick up to two champions/positions, so you can queue with 100% confidence that you'll play who you want, where you want.

WHY IS QUICKPLAY REPLACING BLIND PICK?
The short version: We wanted to create a mode that was better-suited for new players and made it easier for you to pick a certain champion in a certain lane without all the extra hurdles of Champ Select.


PREPARING FOR QUICKPLAY
two-champs-full-screen.png
Unlike other game modes, your champion/position selection happens before you enter the queue. This way you're guaranteed to always get one of the two champs you pick, and you'll never be forced outside of your top two positions. Once you've picked your champions, don't forget to customize their Runes, Spells, and skin. 

In order to get Quickplay into your hands… well, quickly, we had to delay a few features—including Chromas. But don't worry! They'll be available soon enough in a future update.

There are a few rules in place that vary slightly depending on how many friends you queue up with:

SOLO RULES
2 unique champions
2 unique positions (minimum 1 priority)
""Priority"" positions are dynamically chosen based on which positions need more players throughout the server. In the example below, there are already too many players vying for middle and bottom, so you'd have to swap one pick to a lesser-chosen position in order to enter the queue.

2–4 PLAYER PARTY RULES
All solo rules apply to each player
Minimum of 1 unique champion per player across the party
Primary slot selections must be unique across the party (champion and position)
5 PLAYER PARTY RULES
1 unique champion per player across the party
1 unique position per player across the party
You can all run it down mid together once the game has begun, but you'll all have to lock in a single unique champion for a single unique position before joining up.

Because One-for-All is a totally different game mode.

OTHER DIFFERENCES
Once the game starts, the differences between Quickplay and any other game mode are minimal.

You'll get visual indicators of your assigned lane when the match starts
Surrender votes are available starting at 10 minutes (4-out-of-5 players required, reduced to 3-out-of-5 at 15 minutes)
Like Blind Pick before, there's a chance of the same champion(s) being on both teams
Besides those small differences, it's just like any other Summoner's Rift match.

WHEN IS QUICKPLAY MODE COMING OUT?
Quickplay is already available on the PBE and will have a staggered release to live service starting Patch 13.22.

QUICKPLAY MATCHMAKING
At its heart, Quickplay is just the evolved version of Blind Pick—which is why it'll use the same MMR you had for Blind Pick."
General,Quickplay Mode,"What is Quickplay?
Quickplay is a new queue that will replace Blind Pick and give you faster access to the game, with a faster process that asks players to make their choices up-front and then goes directly from the lobby to the game. Meaning, there is no champ select in this mode.

Moving champion and position choices to the lobby gets you in game faster, with higher agency over what (and who) you play, and cutting out some of the collisions, toxicity, and complexity that comes with Blind Pick.

So if you only have time for one game, you can queue up with confidence knowing that when the queue pops, it’s game on!

What’s wrong with Blind Pick?
BP = Blood Pressure?
Blind Pick was designed and optimized for fast queue times. It pushes player choice into champ select, which makes the queue pop quickly. But, there are only so many lanes. Asking players to negotiate a functional team comp with strangers, against the clock, and with limited communication tools is a recipe for friction.

This is fine for players with an auto-fill mindset, but imagine: You get home from work and just want to try out the new champ, or maybe you’re getting back into League after a long break and want to ease back in on a comfort pick. For a queue with no bans, it’s tough to play what you want in Blind Pick.

Some players bypass the negotiation altogether by locking in first. This gives an unfair advantage to those with the fastest fingers and it forces everyone else to fill in what’s left or leave.

Trust
Experimental players and folks who just want to practice have multiple hurdles to overcome in Blind Pick. Say they want to try out Warwick mid—not only do they need to get lucky in champ select with both position and champion choices, but they also risk queue dodges for their unorthodox pick. Get right onto the Rift and show `em who’s a good boy.

Not-so-welcome to Summoner’s Rift
Players who are newer to the game have an even harder time with this setup. They have limited champion pools and narrow positional flexibility. If they get forced into jungle because their teammates lock in everything else, we can't be too surprised when they end up in lane because they don’t know where to go.

Another one
Last but not least, when the game is clearly over and you just want to go next before the tilt sets in, the current surrender rules make it tough to get out and play another match.

All that said, we think the original promise of getting into a game of SR at light speed is still valid and valuable. That's what we want to deliver... minus the bad stuff. Now, let’s get into the details.

How does Quickplay work?
In the lobby, players will choose Primary and Secondary champions and positions. Spells and loadouts can be changed from here as well by using a new menu.

In order to keep the queue popping quickly, one of your position choices must be a “Priority” position. These are positions that are most needed by the current matchmaking pool (the UI will tell you which is needed).

The intent is that you get your first choice most of the time, but there will be times when you have to play in a Priority position. This is something we will keep a close eye on numbers-wise and tune accordingly.

Here are the specific rules for different party sizes:

Solo

2 unique champions

2 unique positions

Minimum of 1 Priority position

2-4 players

All solo rules apply to each player

Minimum of 1 unique champion per player across the party

Primary slot selections must be unique across the party (champion and position)

Full team of 5

No Secondary choices required

1 unique champion and position per player across the party

To address being stuck in a lopsided match, we have lowered the surrender requirements a bit. The first surrender vote will be available at 10 minutes, down from 15, but still requires 4 of the 5 players to vote yes. Once the game hits 20 minutes, surrender will only require 3 of the 5 players to vote yes.

While this may mean that stomps won’t get to play out fully as often, that’s probably a good thing for an unranked queue. The flip side is, games that go the distance will likely be closer and worth your time!

This tuning is also something we’ll be keeping an eye on to make sure match times are healthy and most games don’t end at 10 minutes.

What are we hoping to see?
We want you to feel like this queue is a fast and easy way to enjoy SR gameplay, without the extra pre-game time.

In Quickplay, you should get to play what you want and be on the Rift shortly after hitting the Find Match button. You should feel like you can queue up with friends of different skill levels and, if the game goes sideways in a hurry, you aren’t trapped—just go next and queue up again.

The Beta Test Mindset
Quickplay’s core loop is ready to go, but at launch it will be missing some features like chroma selection and you may run into small hitches or visual bugs. Rather than hold Quickplay’s release for an extended period of time, we want to get it to you early, validate what we’ve got, and work with you to improve it over time.

Here’s the timeline:

Quickplay hits PBE in 13.21 dev cycle for core functionality.
Quickplay release to live in the following patches after 13.21, in a staggered way, from region to region.
As always we are eager to hear your feedback. Cheers and see you on the Rift!"
General,Arena Mode,"WHAT IS ARENA?
Arena is a 2v2v2v2v2v2v2v2 (16 players!) game mode for League of Legends where you face off against other pairs across multiple maps (Rings) over the course of several rounds, whittling down your opponent's team health until only one duo stands victorious.

You'll also get to choose from a random selection of Augments as you go, making every match fun and intense in its own unique way.

Of course, this is just a broad overview, so read on for the deets.

SCHEDULE
Arena's back from May 1 to September 10 at 18:00 PT.

To give you time to acclimate to the various changes, ranked progression won't begin until Patch 14.10 on May 15. That said, your secret Arena MMR will change depending on your performance before then, possibly resulting in greater Gladiator Point gains and quicker climbing when the Ranked season does officially start.

ARENA LOBBY
QUEUE UP WITH MORE FRIENDS
The queue is even more expanded this time around. While jumping in solo is always an option, you'll be able to queue up in groups of 2–8 players. Even full 16-stacks are welcome, but you won't make any ranked progression if the lobby is just you and your buds—gotta earn that climb!

The Arena experience begins the moment you enter the lobby.

You and your duo show up on one side of the lobby while the other teams appear on the right. You'll immediately notice several key differences from Summoner's Rift, such as…

No Runes - Arena's tempo makes certain rune choices less meaningful, so they've been removed entirely. Besides, many of the in-game Augments feature powered-up versions of the existing runes. Use those to custom-tailor your playstyle.

Preset Summoner Spells - Everybody starts with the same two Summoner Spells: Flash and Flee (which is similar to Ghost), though you'll sometimes have the option to swap out Flee via Augment.

Semi-Draft Pick - One player from each team makes a pick, then those picks are revealed before each duo completes their team. Time for counterpicks!

One Bans Per Team - The first player of each team gets a ban, rounding out to 8 bans overall. To change who gets to pick the ban, swap pick order.

Once everybody's locked and loaded, it's time to enter Arena.

PREPARATION PHASE
Every round begins with a preparation phase where you'll receive a variety of avenues to powering up, including Gold, Augments, and Anvils. Use this time to scout out the competition, stretch those wrists, or slam some Juice (irl or otherwise).

ROUND        BONUS        CHAMPION LEVEL
1        500 Gold, Augment        3
2        500 Gold        5
3        Prismatic Anvil        7
4        2500 Gold        9
5        2250 Gold
High Stakes: +15 Health for winning        11
6        Augment        12
7        Stat Anvil        13
8        2250 Gold        14
9        Augment
High Stakes: +15 Health for winning        15
10        Stat Anvil        16
11        2250 Gold        17
12        Augment        18
13        2250 Gold
High Stakes: +15 Health for winning        18
14        2250 Gold        18
15        2250 Gold        18
ANVILS
You can purchase most of the items available in Summoner's Rift once you get some Gold, but you also have access to Arena-specific items/perks through Anvils as the match goes on. They're sometimes handed out to all players as listed above, but they can also be purchased directly from the Shop:

Prismatic - 4000 Gold: Randomized choice between all Prismatic items, Arena-specific gear that can take your build to the next level.
Legendary - 2000 Gold: Randomized choice between Legendary items within your desired class (fighter, mage, etc).
Stat - 750 Gold: Randomized choices between raw stat upgrades.
You can re-roll an Anvil if you don't like your choices, but keep in mind this will come from the same re-roll pool as your Augments.

AUGMENTS
Augments are special game-altering effects that, once selected, apply for the rest of the current game. They come in three flavors of increasing intensity: Silver, Gold, and Prismatic. While the rarity is random, you can rest assured that all players are offered the same level of power.

There's a huge variety of Augments, and many of them interact in strange, interesting, and powerful ways. Don't be afraid to explore new options or dial in on a cracked combo.

JUICE
Earn a little extra money from knocking out your opponents? Consider knocking back a tasty Juice© for a short-term buff, now available every round.

JUICE        SINGLE ROUND BUFF
Juice of Power        AD/AP
Juice of Vitality        Health/Size
Juice of Haste        Ability Haste
Cappa Juice        Get a SWEET HAT that lasts the entire match (with no other effect)
Although you can't stack the same kind of Juice*, you CAN drink different kinds of Juice together to get their cumulative effect. 

*Cappa Juice is the only exception. Just like real life, hats can be stacked infinitely.
hats-on-hats-on-hats.jpg

COMBAT PHASE
Ready. Set. FIGHT!

Once preparation finishes, your team of two will be transported to one of four rings where you'll face off against another pairing. Last team standing wins the round, while the defeated team will lose health based on the round. 

ROUND        DAMAGE FOR DEFEAT
1–4        15
5–8        25
9–12        45
13–16        55
Win any of the bolded rounds above (5, 9, and 13) to gain 15 Health.

Win or lose, getting a kill will score you 250 Gold.

RING OF FIRE
If your match runs longer than 30 seconds, a ring of fire will begin to close in around your ring every few seconds. You'll receive a small amount of health %-based true damage whenever you're standing in the fire, so try to avoid the flames if possible. If the ring closes entirely, damage ramps up significantly. If you and your opponent both somehow manage to endure the flames for another 15 seconds after they've reached peak intensity, the round will end in a tie, dealing damage to both teams.

With this version of Arena, the ring of fire's flames will leave lasting-but-unseen burns. If you spend an exceptionally long time within the flames, you'll take even more damage—and this extra damage can persist between rounds.

RINGS OF WRATH
The mode may be called ""Arena,"" but it actually features FIVE different rings you can battle on throughout the competition.

FROSTBITE THICKET

DESERT OASIS

KOI POND

TERRAIN AND PLANTS
Arena boasts a few exclusive features to give you even more tactical options:

Deep Water (terrain): Doesn't block vision but otherwise acts like any other terrain.
Power Flower (plant): Gives Shield, Heal, Mana, and partial Cooldown refund on all abilities each time it's hit.
Bridge Bloom (terrain/plant): Can be walked on for a limited time before disappearing. If you're on it when it vanishes, you'll be knocked up and over to the closest piece of terrain.
CAMEOS
Not content to just sit around and let you have the fun, the following champions appear in your ring on random rounds throughout the match to add their own unique brand of chaos to the proceedings:

Lux
Sett
Pyke
Jhin
Thresh
DOWN BUT NOT OUT
If your teammate is defeated, a circle will appear at the place of their death after a few seconds. Stand in this circle for a few seconds, and they'll return to your side. Just because your teammate falls doesn't mean you'll have to finish the fight alone!

Each team only gets one revive per round, so treat your second life like it's your last.

END GAME
Once your team health drops to 0, it's game over. You can choose to stick around and see who wins or leave without penalty, after which you can jump right back into the queue. Just know that the results aren't tallied until a final pair of victors emerges from the fray, so you may not see progress on your missions if you leave immediately after being knocked out early

If an odd number of teams remain at any point, one team will be randomly selected to sit out a match. Take a breather—you've earned it.

CHALLENGE PROGRESSION
Check the Legacy Challenges tab to peruse Arena-specific challenges. Progress far enough and you'll get a Title for your efforts.

Just remember that challenges won't track until the match is complete. If you get knocked out early, you'll have to wait a bit to see where you stand.

RANKING SYSTEM
Arena's ranking system mirrors its gameplay philosophy—simple, fun, and competitive.

ARENA TIERS
ranks.jpg

TIER        GLADIATOR POINTS
Wood        0–1399
Bronze        1400–2599
Silver        2600–3299
Gold        3300–3999
Gladiator        4000+
Your current tier is shown via your in-lobby banner and in the post-game report.

PLACEMENTS AND CLIMBING
All players are initially seeded in the Wood tier (heh) at 500 Ranking Points, plus any points you earn for winning. But don't sweat it if victory is not forthcoming, as you'll be protected from losing any Gladiator Points until you reach the Gladiator tier. Your hidden Arena-specific MMR will still change behind the scenes to ensure you're getting fair matches while you climb, but becoming a true Gladiator is attainable to all players so long as you're earning Ranking Points by placing 4th or above. You'll start losing Gladiator Points for placing 5th or below once you hit Gladiator, but you'll never drop below 4000 Gladiator Points..

NO DEMOTIONS
Since Arena is coming to you fresh out of the oven, we want to emphasize fun and experimentation over a harrowing climb. That's why you won't be able to get demoted out of a tier. Fight ever onward and upward!"

General,Howling Abyss (ARAM) FAQ,"Basic Info
SO, WHAT IS THE HOWLING ABYSS? AND WHAT DOES ARAM MEAN?
Howling Abyss is your battlefield, and ARAM is the game mode acronym which means ""All Random All Mid."" Think of it as a single lane, no-holds-barred battle between two teams of 5. Prepare yourself as a random champion is assigned to each player in this fast-paced, team-fight heavy game mode.

WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES AND DIFFERENCES ON HOWLING ABYSS?
ARAM is unlike any other League game mode in a few different ways:

Hexgates: Players can use Hexgates that are accessed from their Nexus Fountain and transport them quickly to the furthest, first-tier turret. When the first-tier turret goes down, the Hexgate then transports them to the second-tier turret.
Collapsing Turrets: When first-tier turrets collapse, they leave rubble to the north or south side that permanently alter the map for the remainder of the game.
Little Legend Companions: Players of Teamfight Tactics will recognize their favorite Little Legends who join their Champion on the Bridge. These companions are NPCs and just add a little cuteness and personality to every match.
NOTE: CHIBI CHAMPION LITTLE LEGENDS CANNOT BE EQUIPPED IN ARAM
Doing so could split open the multiverse and we can’t have that!

  
WHAT CHAMPIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CHAMPION POOL?
We want ARAM to be the random, wild adrenaline rush. As such, the champion pool will contain all of the following 65 champions, along with the current week's free-to-play rotation. 

Aatrox	Ahri	Akali	Amumu	Annie
Ashe	Brand	Braum	Caitlyn	Cho'Gath
Darius	Draven	Ekko	Ezreal	Fiora
Fizz	Garen	Graves	Irelia	Janna
Jarvan IV	Jax	Jhin	Jinx	Karma
Karthus	Katarina	Kayle	Kha'Zix	LeBlanc
Lee Sin	Leona	Lucian	Lulu	Lux
Malphite	Maokai	Master Yi	Miss Fortune	Mordekaiser
Morgana	Nautilus	Nidalee	Pantheon	Pyke
Quinn	Renekton	Riven	Ryze	Sivir
Sona	Soraka	Thresh	Tristana	Tryndamere
Twisted Fate	Twitch	Varus	Vayne	Veigar
Vel'Koz	Vladimir	Wukong	Xayah	Zed
WHERE DID ARAM COME FROM?
ARAM was originally a custom game type created by players on Summoner's Rift. Because Summoner's Rift is a 3 lane map, players created a rule where all summoners had to meet up and battle in the middle. Players trusted one another to abide by certain restrictions on items, summoner spells, and returning to base. This ended up becoming so popular that it became official. Thus ARAM was born!

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD ARAM MAP?
The bridge collapsed from all of the stress and strain from the thousands of battles that took place on it.

DOES THAT MEAN THE TUTORIAL MAP WILL NOW BE ON THE HOWLING ABYSS?
Actually, the tutorial will be over on Summoner's Rift.

Matchmaking
CAN I EARN XP FROM ARAM?
Yes!

IS THERE AN OPTION TO PLAY HOWLING ABYSS IN QUICKPLAY OR DRAFT PICK?
No, these are not available for matchmade games. However, these options are available for custom games!

WHY AREN'T THOSE MODES AVAILABLE FOR MATCHMAKING?
Based on previous tests on the old ARAM map, the percentage of players that selected these picks modes was simply lower than the random romp we have currently. This doesn't mean these modes aren't fun though, so we encourage you to experiment within your custom games.

CAN I SEE MY OPPONENTS' CHAMPIONS IN THE CHAMPION SELECT SCREEN?
Nope! Your opponents' champions will remain hidden until the loading screen. This means your team will remain hidden to your opponents as well.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I QUEUE DODGE DURING CHAMPION SELECT?
You suffer a timer penalty and lose any reroll points you may have used during champion select.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I LEAVE A MATCHMADE ARAM GAME?
You will suffer the same penalty as leaving any other matchmade game. The LeaverBuster system also applies to this map!

Rerolls
WHAT'S A REROLL? AND WHAT'S WITH THE BENCH?!
When in the champion select screen, you have the option to reroll for another random champion as long as you have enough points to do so. This means you can reroll more than once.

Whenever you reroll a champion, that champ is sent to the Available Champions Pool, or the bench. There, your teammates (or you) can trade for it!

CAN I USE A REROLL AND END UP WITH THE SAME CHAMPION AGAIN?
No.

HOW DO I EARN POINTS FOR REROLLS?
You gain points as you play matchmade ARAM games.

HOW MANY REROLL POINTS DO I EARN PER GAME?
Win or lose, you earn a base number of points every match plus a bonus amount based on the amount of champions you own.

WHAT HAPPENS TO MY POINTS FOR THE REROLL IF SOMEONE OTHER THAN MYSELF DODGES?
If the match is disbanded due to an enemy or ally queue dodging, the cost is refunded.  If the ally dodging was someone in your premade, you will still be refunded your reroll points.

Skin Boosts
WHAT ARE SKIN BOOSTS?
For 95 RP, Skin Boosts unlock one random champion skin for every member of your team for the current game only. They also grant the purchaser 200 bonus Blue Essence for the game, as well as an additional 100 BE for all of your allies. 

HOW DO I UNLOCK SKIN BOOSTS?
Click the ""Boost"" button found above your Runes and Summoner Spells.

WHICH CHAMPION SKINS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN SKIN BOOSTING?
You have a chance to unlock any champion skin currently available for purchase in the store. Skins that are unavailable in the store, such as Legacy or Limited skins, will not be granted. Of course, you can also use any skins you already own for that champion! Note that chromas are not included in Skin Boosts. 

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU REROLL OR TRADE CHAMPIONS?
If you reroll or trade champions after a Skin Boost has been unlocked, you will still get a new random skin with your new champion pick. However, if you reselect the champion you traded away or rerolled, you'll have the original Boosted skin that was granted to you. 

WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE DODGES AFTER I PURCHASE A SKIN BOOST?
If someone dodges after you've unlocked a Skin Boost, don't panic! You won't be charged and your RP will remain in your account. 

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TWO PLAYERS TRY PURCHASING A SKIN BOOST? 
Only one Skin Boost can be purchased per game. If multiple people try purchasing a Skin Boost, only the first purchase will go through and the others will be stopped.

ARE SKIN BOOSTS REFUNDABLE?
Skin Boosts are not refundable. Please refer to our Global Refund Policy for more information."

No matter which mode you choose, we can't wait to see how you grow as a Summoner.

GLHF!"
General,Behavior Worthy of a Champion,"One of the most common questions we receive in support is how to NOT get reported, especially while dealing with the challenges of Ranked Play.

Tl;dr, the best way to avoid getting reported is to prevent disruptive situations from ever occurring. There’s a twofold method to our madness:

Players have more fun in a friendly environment.
Teams free of negative behavior win more games! (And who doesn’t love to win?)
But taking care of your own emotional state is only half the battle. What can you do when someone else starts acting poorly? Is it even your responsibility? Why should you even care?

When you start to feel the creep of irritation, it's important to remember Baron Nashor. He's strong. He's intimidating. Most importantly, he doesn't have a team by his side. When tilt sets in, it can be easy to idolize this lone wolf...err, lone monster. However, look at what happens to Baron when a team works together to take him down. Regardless of skill or rank, it's always easier to take down your enemies when you work together, rather than against one another

The goal here is to take down the (metaphorical) objectives and win more games as a result! Hopefully the ideas below will help you prepare for the task ahead: 

 

THE POWER OF PATIENCE
There could be several situations where surrender may be the wisest option, but more often than not, surrender occurs because a team has lost the will to persevere. While a quick victory can be immensely satisfying, a game’s outcome cannot be predicted at first blood. Take a deep breath and try to rally your troops before waving the white flag. There’s nothing quite like a come-from-behind victory.

 

TEMPER YOUR EXPECTATIONS
Luck can only take you so far, and victory cannot be achieved just by showing up to the Rift. Winning takes a lot of work and coordination, and you are just as likely to get cooperative teammates as your opponents. Try your best to win every game you play, but don't expect it to turn out that way every time.

 

KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE
Every team has different strengths and weaknesses, and it can be counterproductive to stick to a specific play style or strategy after the champions are locked in. To paraphrase Charles Darwin, it is not the strongest that survives, nor the most intelligent, but rather the one most adaptable to change.

 

BETTER TOGETHER
Our statistics show the likelihood of winning decreases by roughly 10% for each disruptive player on any given team. But don’t be discouraged! The chance to win increases significantly with each positive person on the team. Being that pillar of tilt-proof strength is often the difference between victory and defeat.

As human beings, we are often quick to judge but slow to praise, especially when it comes to strangers. Try turning that around – highlight your teammates achievements in-game. It doesn’t matter if it’s a game changing moment or a minor victory, words of encouragement can have a far greater impact on the outcome of the game than any critique ever could (we promise). Besides, you are nearly twice as likely to avoid getting reported while engaging in positive reinforcement!

 

THE PERILS OF PEER PRESSURE
Everyone has had a bad game. We bet you can recall a few times where everything went wrong (your team is outmatched, your enemies have Baron, you’re down in gold…you get the gist). It’s pretty likely that in those situations, team morale was at an all time low. And just as all hope seemed lost...inevitably someone says something unkind. Talk about twisting the Noxian knife! 

Statistics show that people perform consistently WORSE under pressure. Losing a lane is already stressful enough without adding more negativity to the situation, so show some empathy and buff your teammate.

 

MAKE MORALE A MAIN OBJECTIVE
Enduring the frustration of your teammates can often lead to your own in-game irritation. Let's say a lane is at a disadvantage because a player gave up a few early kills. That player is probably really frustrated because they feel like they’re dragging down the whole team. The worst thing to do in that moment is scold them. Instead, try finding out what resulted in those early losses and, as a team, orchestrate solutions!

Did the lane get ganked by a jungler? Ward the lane for them. Did the lane get pushed directly? Gank the enemy champion. You might spend 75 or 100 gold on a ward, miss a wave or maybe even give up your own tower, but you will help the struggling element of your team catch up, and most importantly, relieve some of the natural stress that comes from losing a lane. Remember, of all the resources in the game, your team's morale is the one you cannot afford to lose!

 

STAND STRONG
Let's be honest, situations where the teams are uneven (due to a summoner leaving the game, for example) suck. That is why we have a Leaverbuster system implemented to punish leaves, alongside after-game reports.

Frustrating as it may be, a 4v5 situation is not necessarily an automatic defeat. The person who dropped out might experience an intermittent connection issue and could return shortly. Here are some tactics that you can employ in the meantime:

Contest objectives:

You may experience more lane pressure, so you’ll need to catch up in gold quickly. Force your opponent to fight at objectives rather than pushing your towers. This way, you control the battlefield!

Ward your jungle:

This helps set up ganks if the opposition is pushing all lanes equally. Alternatively, this will help you dictate engagement if the enemy team does not have the vision in your jungle.

Engage on your own terms:

Attacking an enemy from a position where they lack vision will help enormously with target focus and dealing an extra chunk of damage in a pinch.

Kill the carries first:

Even if you are unable to win a straight up team fight, you can still catch the Marksman/AD carry on their own, which will slow the enemy push considerably (and buy time for your teammate to reconnect).

Don’t be that guy:

Remember. Opponents can’t see disconnection messages on your team, so DO NOT BE THAT GUY!



Never give up, never surrender:
Perhaps you won't win this game, and like we said before, surrender can be the right option. However, if you end the game with a positive outlook, your opponents will know that brave champions stood united, unfazed by overwhelming odds."
General,Choosing the Right Champion,"Do you see yourself as an unstoppable avatar of destruction, or are you an immovable mountain, silent and eternal? Perhaps you would like to be a cunning predator - lurking in the jungle, ready to strike from the shadows? Whatever your playstyle is, we have a Champion for you!

We have over one hundred and ten Champions to choose from in League of Legends - each with a unique blend of special abilities, art and lore. The sheer amount of choice can seem daunting, but fear not - following the tips below, you should be able to pick out a Champion that will let you play the way you want to!

STILL NOT SURE IF YOU WANT TO COMMIT?
 

What do you want to do?
Our Champions are divided into several roles which roughly represent their attitude towards combat:



ASSASSIN
Katarina.png	
Assassins are able to eliminate an enemy Champion in an instant by pulling off a powerful combination of attacks and abilities.

High movement speed
Abilities that allow them to reposition and/or maneuver quickly
High burst damage (Attack Damage or Ability Power)
""Violence solves everything!"" - Katarina, the Sinister Blade

 

MARKSMAN
	
A marksman attacks from range, and primarily use their abilities to maintain safe positioning and provide additional firepower. They are usually defined by the following characteristics:

Glass cannon – high damage but very low defense
Consistent damage throughout a fight
Adept at maintaining distance from opponents
""One tribe, one people, one Freljord."" - Ashe, the Frost Archer
 

FIGHTER
Garen.png	
Fighters dish out and absorb high amounts of damage.

Engages in close range with a balance of offense and defense
Abilities help mitigate damage taken or amplify damage dealt in key situations
Varied item build paths
""The most effective way to kill an opponent is to slice through the man next to him."" - Garen, the Might of Demacia
 

MAGE
	
Mages rely primarily on using skill combos to maximize damage. While they're capable of dealing massive damage, they're squishy and usually lack an escape route.

Often reliant on chaining spells together to maximize damage
Skills range from high single-target burst damage to devastating area of effect attacks
Fairly vulnerable while their skills are on cooldown
""Ready to set the world on fire?"" - Brand, the Burning Vengeance
 

SUPPORT
Taric.png	
A Champion that manipulates the battlefield through more subtle means than sheer damage output. Often in control of providing vision through wards and dictating map control.

Very high combat utility, incapacitating or weakening enemies and strengthening allies
Item build paths often include items with abilities, further increasing utility
Significantly stronger when fighting near their team
""Gems? Gems are truly outrageous. They are truly, truly, truly outrageous."" - Taric the Gem Knight
 

TANK
Alistar.png	
Tanks have the strongest defensive capabilities in the game.  Their abilities usually focus on increasing these capabilities, as well as dealing damage which increases the longer they stay in the fight. They're often the first Champion to engage the enemy team in combat.

Very large health pool, armor and magic resistance
Damage-dealing capabilities that start low but increase as a battle rages
Able to initiate fights with the enemy team and stay alive until their team can safely engage
""Mess with the bull and you get the horns!"" - Alistar the Minotaur
If you're still unsure about the roles above, we suggest that you try out the Battle training. You will be able to choose between Ashe, Ryze or Garen and they should give you an understanding of the basics.



 

Champion filtering
When searching through Champions, you can filter them by role. Click on your summoner profile and select the Champions tab in the client.



Adjust the Champion filter by ticking various roles or typing their name into the Find window. You can also select the pool of Champions that you want to filter the results from, i.e. owned or not owned Champions. After applying the filter, the Champions that match the query will be displayed on the right of the filter menu. You can even use the text filter during Champion select, as shown below!





 

A note on Champion adaptability
Many Champions fit within more than one of these roles, or can be specialized differently based on their item build. For example, Vayne is a marksman, but her short-term stealth mechanics and potential for high burst damage makes her feel a bit like an assassin. Leona is a powerful support champion, but she has a short-term, highly defensive buff as well as persistent, threatening damage through her passive.  This makes her a competent tank.

You can further establish your Champion's role (or help them blend two roles) through their item build.  The recommended items for each Champion is a decent template for a standard game within the Champion's role, but you should definitely experiment to find the right build for you and your team each game. Naturally, we encourage our Summoners to experiment and try out different combinations!  If you find a build that supports your playstyle, create a custom Item Set to help you remember it for future games!



 

Making a decision
The only thing better than defeating your opponents is defeating your opponents in style. - Jayce
Before you invest in a Champion, ask yourself the following questions:

Do you like the look of the Champion, or its skins?
Do you like the story behind the Champion?
Does this Champion's playstyle sound interesting?
If you answered yes to all 3 questions, then go for it, but remember that there's no point in buying a Champion just because of their abilities or current balance situation We're always on the lookout for necessary balance changes, so don't bet on abilities to be too strong or too weak forever.

If you want to find out more about the Champion's background and motivations, you can click on their portrait in your list of owned Champions (or in the Store). You can also preview the said Champion's skills and abilities by watching the videos in the Abilities section.



 

FREE CHAMPION ROTATION
Every week we choose 14 different Champions that can be played for free.  We choose a variety of Champions from different roles, to help players test out Champions they might be on the fence about, or simply to help pad out a new player's roster.  If you would like to know more about how we choose the Champions for Free Rotation, you can read about it here:

http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=46045



NEW PLAYER CHAMPION ROTATION
There's a lot to learn in League of Legends, so it's easier for new players to start with Champions who have relatively straightforward abilities. Before players reach level 11, they can take advantage of a special Champion rotation suited to newer players. This pool is different per region and changes occasionally, but will always include Champions whose abilities are intuitive and forgiving.

General,/Remake FAQ,"During a suspiciously-long loading screen, there's more time than you might like to think about how you're gonna pull off this 4v5, or how you're going to make the most of the next twenty minutes by practicing last hitting. /Remake balances the playing field by offering a third option: vote to end the game early and honorably, with no penalty to anyone but the inactive player (and, in high-level competitive play, their premade).

/Remake is available in normal and ranked Summoner's Rift, Howling Abyss, and rotating game modes, but not in bot matches.

How to /Remake
Starting with patch 12.21 on November 2, 2022, the /remake feature will function as follows:

IN-GAME TIME	/REMAKE STATUS
0:00–1:30	Player activity/connection is monitored, but /remake is unavailable.
1:30–3:00	/remake unlocks if a player is determined to be disconnected or inactive for at least 90 seconds. If this occurs close to the 3-minute mark, their team will be given a minimum of 30 seconds to type /remake (e.g. If a player hits 90 seconds of inactivity at 2:45, their team will have until 3:15 to type /remake.)
3:00–End of Game	/remake is no longer available, but any /remakes initiated before 3:00 will be given at least 30 seconds to conclude.
Outside of this timeline, but there are a few other rules that may determine the success of a /remake vote, or even its availability:

If a player AFKs/disconnects after their team gives up First Blood, their team will be unable to /remake.
/remake votes can only be initiated once. Make it count!
In a 4v5, at least two players must vote ""yes"" for the game to end. In a 3v5 or lower, a single player can make the call.
Once the vote passes, the game ends. You'll neither gain nor lose LP/BE/XP, and you won't see a win or loss on your record—only the inactive players (and Diamond IV and above players in their premade) are punished.

Additionally, a game that goes through a /remake will not count for any features that require a player to reach a number of completed games. This includes low priority queue, unlocking icons or other content, and more.

Penalties
If you're the inactive player in a match, you'll receive the following penalties:

A loss on your record; if you were in a promo series, you'll lose one game towards it.
LP loss, just as though you'd lost the match.
Your account will be flagged by LeaverBuster, the same way as if you'd disconnected from a normal match.
For Diamond IV and above, if someone in your premade is the cause of a /remake, you'll take the same penalties they do.
FAQ
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A /REMAKE VOTE IS SUCCESSFUL?
The game ends with both Nexuses safe and sound. All players enter the end-game lobby and are free to play again. Disconnected players are penalized by LeaverBuster and incur a loss; the rest go on penalty-free.

ISN'T THE PLURAL OF NEXUS NEXI?
No. It's like octopuses.

DO EXECUTIONS AFFECT /REMAKE?
Executions won't stop a /remake, only a PvP kill will. Still, walk toward the enemy towers at your own risk.

WHAT IF A PLAYER DISCONNECTS SHORTLY AFTER THE GAME BEGINS?
As long as the player is disconnected for 90 consecutive seconds, and remains disconnected up to 3:00, /remake will be an option. So, /remake is available if a player disconnects at 1:00, but not if they disconnect at 2:00.

WHAT HAPPENS IF A PLAYER DIES DURING THE /REMAKE VOTE?
Deaths after 3:00 won't affect /remake eligibility; once you're offered the option to /remake, you're free to duel that Yasuo until the game ends. Just make sure you vote!

AS A DIAMOND IV PLAYER, IF I'M PLAYING WITH A PLAT PLAYER WHO DISCONNECTS, WILL I LOSE LP IF A /REMAKE VOTE GOES THROUGH?
Yes. Diamond IV players and above queued with a disconnected player will incur a loss from /remake, regardless of that player's division. Diamond players outside of a premade will not take a loss.

AS A PLAT PLAYER, IF I'M PLAYING WITH A DIAMOND PLAYER WHO DISCONNECTS, WILL I BE SUBJECT TO A PENALTY?
No. Even if you're queued with a Diamond player, you'll only incur a loss if you're also Diamond or above.

DO THE DIAMOND RULES APPLY TO NORMAL GAMES?
No, you can /remake without penalty in normal games if someone in your premade disconnects. Note that if you're the inactive player, you'll still receive normal penalties—the game will count as a loss, and you'll be flagged by LeaverBuster.

CAN MULTIPLE PLAYERS BE PUNISHED IN A SINGLE GAME, EVEN WHEN NOT PREMADE?
Yes. If there are multiple inactive players (premade or not), they will all receive the penalties for /remake. This includes players who decided to AFK while waiting for /remake to appear. It's highly advised you remain active even if you know or think a player is not going to connect, or you risk receiving the penalties also!

IF I DO NOT MOVE FROM BASE AFTER MY TEAM VOTES TO REMAKE, CAN I GET A PENALTY TOO?
Yes - Make sure you’re moving around even if your team decides to remake. If you stand idle the system will detect you as AFK and you may face penalties as well."
Honor,Honor FAQ,"HONOR LEVEL RESET
Why does my Honor level reset?

Your Honor level resets at season start just like your rank. Unless you were below Honor level 2 before the new season, everyone starts between Honor levels 2 and 3.

Why does my Honor level reset to a checkpoint?

Players who consistently fought with honor in their games and finished at higher Honor levels earn a head start to getting better rewards than those who didn’t. You can see which checkpoint you’re reset to on the Honor website.

HONOR ORBS
How do I get Honor Orbs?

You get an Honor Orb every time you reach a checkpoint past level 3. Even though checkpoints stop after level 5, you still get level 5 Orbs at the same intervals as checkpoints. Since there’s no level 6, they aren’t called checkpoints.

Do Orbs need keys to open?

No, they’re like Capsules and entirely keyless.

Do Orbs get better at every checkpoint?

No. Orbs get better at every level.

Do Orbs get better as I level up in Honor?

Yes! Orbs have more key fragments and better rewards each time you level up.

So I dropped from Honor level 5 because of a penalty. Do I still get Orbs when I reach checkpoints?

Yes! You’ll get an Orb for that level every time you reach a checkpoint.

HONOR LEVELS
Do I need to do anything special to progress?

You level up just by playing to win in your games. Show up, don’t intentionally work against team, and you’ll progress in the coming weeks and months. If your teammates honor you a lot, you’ll get a slight bonus in progression and rewards like loading screen flairs.

If I get no Honors, do I still level up?

You will. All you have to do is show up and try to win in all your games.

Does voting for my teammates contribute to my Honor level?

Yes, but you’ll need a little help. A whole team gets a slight bonus to their honor level if every teammate votes. Just like the game, you win or lose as a team.

Do I get better rewards at higher Honor levels?

Yes! We heard your feedback and made sure your rewards level up when you do. Orbs and Capsules have better rewards with every level up.

Can I game the system and boost to level 5 by constantly playing with a premade and honoring each other every game?

Nice idea. We had it too. So we specifically built Honor so potential exploits like this give you (and your friend) literally no benefit.

When will I level up?

After completing three checkpoints in an Honor level, the next milestone is a level up. Checkpoints begin after Honor level two and end when you reach level five.

HONOR CHECKPOINTS
What are checkpoints?

Checkpoints are markers for how far you’ve progressed in a level. You have to complete three checkpoints in every level before leveling up and earn a reward every time you reach one. You won't receive rewards for checkpoints at Honor level 0.

What happens after I finish my third and last checkpoint in a level?

When you reach your third checkpoint, you’re on the way to the next milestone: a level up.

What happens to checkpoints after level 5?

Checkpoints stop after level 5. You’ll still get level 5 Orbs for consistently honorable play, but since there’s no level 6, they aren’t called checkpoints.

I'm Honor level 5 and got reset to level 2, checkpoint 3. Do I miss out on rewards?

You'll miss out on a few Honor level 2 Orbs. But you'll get to higher rewards faster, and they'll keep coming even after you're back at level 5.

HONOR CAPSULES
Why do I get fewer Honor Capsules this season?

With the addition of Honor Orbs, you’ll still get regular and even more consistent rewards. We decided Honor Capsules should be more exclusive and carry the best rewards so reaching the next Honor level feels extra special.

I don’t get random Capsules like before?

Nope. You get three Capsules over the entire season when you reach Honor levels 3, 4, and 5.

What kinds of rewards are in the Honor capsules?

Every Capsule will have a few key fragments, a cosmetic reward, and champion shards. Capsules have better rewards at every level up. Find out what’s inside each one on the Honor website.

How do I get Honor Capsules?

You get an Honor Capsule in your level up ceremony when you reach Honor levels 3, 4, and 5.

Do Honor Capsules need keys to open?

Nope. They're basically key-free chests.

So I got a penalty and dropped from Honor level 5. Can I get Honor Capsules again when I level up?

No. You only get an Honor Capsule once. But you will get an Orb for that level instead.

KEY FRAGMENTS
Do all my key fragments still drop through Honor?

Yes. When we updated Honor last year we decided all key fragments would drop through the new feature. That’s still the case.

How do I get key fragments?

Get all your key fragments by doing two simple things: Playing games, and avoiding Instant Feedback penalties like chat restrictions and bans. That's it. It's an intentionally low bar, because we want you to get your stuff. You don’t need to be honored by teammates to get keys. Individual honors are connected to other rewards like loading screen flairs. Keys can drop whether you win or drop the game. Key fragments hit while browsing the client or on login. You’ll also get key fragments at checkpoints and level ups.

Will I just get keys by idling with the client on?

Not just by idling. You need to play games to get key fragments. So for instance, If you spend your Saturday playing games and leave the client on overnight, you might wake up to a nice surprise. If you just boot up your client and don’t play games, you won’t get any key fragments.

So, they'll just show up sometimes?

Yep. Just like a fed Twitch coming out of stealth.

Are there any changes to chests with Honor?

Just like before, they’ll be locked away for a bit if you’ve been penalized, until your honor is unlocked again.

HONOR RECALLS
How do I get the special Honor recall VFX?

To automatically have your normal recall swapped with a special recall showcasing your good sportsmanship, just meet one of the following conditions:

Reach Honor Level 5
Reach Honor Level 3 or above AND get honored by one or more non-premade teammate in your last game
Reach Honor Level 3 or above AND get honored by two or more premade teammates in your last game
LOADING SCREEN FLAIRS
How do I get a loading screen flair?

First, hit level 3. Then earn honor from two premade teammates or one stranger in one game. The flair will unlock for your next matchmade game.

My flair disappeared after one game, why?

They’re meant to show off that you’re coming off a great game, so they only last one game. Once you're level 3 or better, get an Honor from two premade teammates or one stranger to unlock flair in your next game.

Is there a cooldown on loading screen flairs?

Nope. If you keep earning honors, you'll keep your flair across each game you rock the Rift and earn honors.

Will I get a different loading screen flair per category?

Not today, but that's a damn good idea.

Do they get bigger like Champ Mastery?

They do! At level 4 and 5 the flairs grow.

PENALTIES AND LOCKS
How do I drop a level in Honor?

You’ll only drop if you receive a penalty. A chat restriction knocks your Honor level to 1 if you're at level 2 or higher, or down to 0 if you’re already at level 1. A two week suspension will drop your level to 0 (even if you were higher). In both cases, your honor progress will be locked, making your account ineligible for hextech crafting rewards. Your honor progress will unlock some time after your restriction as long as you show signs of reform.

What do you mean by lock my Honor level and rewards?

You'll see a lock on your Honor level in your profile. This means you aren't making any progress to the next level, and you won't receive any rewards. Unlock your Honor level by putting clean games in. You’ll get a notification when you’ve unlocked your Honor level.

What's the deal with level 1 and 0?

If you fall below level 2, you were hit with a penalty or two, and the first step is to put in clean games to unlock your Honor level. Once you do, your games help you climb back to better rewards, just like how it’s worked since Loot launched.

Are rewards cut for these levels?

At level 1, you earn many less key fragments than normal. At level 0, also known as Dishonorable, you don't get any keys. It’s a bummer, but you can bounce back just by getting clean games in.

MISCELLANEOUS
How does Honor work if I transfer my account across servers?

Unfortunately, Honor won’t transfer. You’ll start on your new server at level 2.

What happens to my old honor ribbons?

They're going away because this is a total system overhaul. Think of this like a Galio-level champ rework, just for a system instead.

What about my old Honor points?

Gone too."
Ranked,Clash FAQ,"WHAT IS CLASH?
When Champions meet, a Clash is inevitable (and loads of fun). Clash is a monthly tournament. This competitive game mode sees you and four fellow players team up to compete against other teams at your skill level.

You can begin forming your team on Monday of Clash Week, but matches will take place on Saturday and/or Sunday. Your team can join an 8-team bracket on either day (or on both!) If you win all three games, you'll get a trophy and awesome prizes! The more games you win, the better your prizes will be! And, if your team loses the first round, you can still play consolation games to keep improving your prize pool.

Your team can only join one Clash bracket each day, and once you've joined, that team is locked in for the entire bracket. However, if things don't go well for you on Saturday, you can still come back Sunday and try again (with the same team, or even a new one!)

CLASH SCHEDULE (2024)
Coordinating five players to play an evening of Clash can be like wrangling poros, but at least with this schedule you'll be able to plan ahead.

CLASH EVENT	PATCH	TEAM FORMATION BEGINS	TOURNAMENT DAYS
Noxus Cup	14.2	January 22	January 27–28
Shurima Cup	14.4	February 19	February 24–25

CREATING YOUR TEAM
To join or create a Summoner's Rift Clash team, you need to have:

Reached level 30
Completed placements in at least one Summoner's Rift ranked queue this year or the year before. Both splits will continue to be included following Patch 13.14 when the Ranked Split changes go live (Eg. For Season 2023 Split 2, players must have completed placements in at least one Summoner's Rift ranked queue out of the following splits:
2023 - Split 2
2023 - Split 1
2022 - (Any Split)
Verified your League account by SMS (this is a new Clash-specific feature, and only mobile/prepaid numbers will be accepted. Internet numbers [VOIP] like Google Voice will not work.)
ARAM Clash still has the account level 30 and SMS verification requirements, but you don’t have to play any ranked to participate. ARAM mains rejoice!

PLEASE NOTE:
There is no Honor Level restriction for Clash.

Each team has a captain who is responsible for adding or removing members, and setting up their team for Clash. Captains can start inviting their squad from the Monday before a Clash tournament. In the Clash tab, they'll pick a team name, logo, and tag to represent their team for the weekend. If more than one teammate owns a specific team logo, you'll unlock chromas of that logo.

Your team will also be assigned a Tier based on your skill. Tier I is the highest, and Tier IV is the lowest. Tiers are based on everyone on the team's Rank, but it is weighted more heavily towards the best player on the team. Your Tier determines who you'll be matched against but also when you can lock-in for your Clash Bracket.

Every team member must submit at least one ticket to enter Clash (read more below).

clashbeta_teamcreation.png

When you've been entered into a bracket, you'll compete with that team for the whole bracket.

CLASH PLACEMENT
Your Clash placement is based on your previous season's Clash MMR. If you've never played Clash before or didn't play last season, you'll be placed according to your Ranked MMR. Unfortunately, you cannot participate in Clash if you were unranked last season. Be sure to play at least your placements this season if you think you'll want to play Clash in the next one!

VERIFICATION AND SMURFING
MOBILE OR PREPAID NUMBERS ONLY!
Please note that we only accept verified mobile or prepaid phone numbers for SMS verification. Internet numbers (i.e. VOIP) like Google Voice will not work.

As a measure against smurfing, you're required to input a valid mobile phone number to participate in Clash. You can remove your number from your account at any time. Just keep in mind that a 6 month waiting period begins the moment you unlink your account. If you ever want to re-link the same number, you'll have to first unlink and then wait 6 months before linking again (no jumping between multiple accounts). When you enter a phone number, you'll be sent a code to verify your account. Repeated incorrect code entries will temporarily lock you out of the verification step. This feature is for Clash only, and is not considered multi-factor authentication.

You'll need to add your country code to your number. You can find country codes here. 

You can verify your account through SMS in the Settings menu or in the Clash tab.

A Clash tournament is only competitive if you get to play against people of your skill level. Smurfing is something we take very seriously in Clash. You can read more about smurfing here. If you play on multiple accounts, be sure to only SMS link your highest-ranked account.

For more information, check out our page on SMS Verification.

BRACKET FORMAT
When your team enters Clash, you’ll be placed into a single-elimination 8-team bracket against teams at the same skill level. Whether your team wins that bracket or not, you can still come back the next day and try again in another 8-team bracket!

On each day, there is also a consolation (lower) bracket held for teams who lost the first match of each day to continue playing. Those teams will face off against the other teams that lost to earn better prizes.

Participation is flexible--you can enter on any day of the tournament. If you win Saturday, but can't play Sunday, that's cool. You can still earn the best prizes in one day (though you'd earn more if you won on both days).

LOCKING IN
Your team can lock-in at any time after Lock-in opens for your Tier. Tier IV can lock-in at any time of the two-hour lock-in window, Tier III can lock-in a half hour later, Tier II can lock in after another half hour, and Tier I can only lock-in for the last half hour. These restrictions help ensure we have enough teams to make quality brackets for everyone.

MATCHMAKING TIERS
Unlike ranked, teams will be assigned a tier for the duration of the weekend. The tiers will roughly divide teams into four sections - Tier IV at the lowest and Tier I at the highest. These tiers are “bottom-weighted”, so there’ll be more players in Tier IV. You’ll see your team’s tier adjust as you add or remove players.

Individual tiers are determined by your Flex or Solo/Duo ranking - and at launch, you’ll also have a rating that is derived from your previous Clash history. Team tiers take a weighted average of the roster, but it heavily prioritizes the highest-skill players—so it’s likely that comps of players with vastly different skills may have some tougher matches ahead. You’ll see a popup if your team has a mixed skillset.

Teams of different tiers won’t meet during the same weekend—consider each tier a totally separate tournament.

SCOUTING
Before the match begins, you'll encounter several features to help you figure out the best strategy to claim victory. First up is the scouting page, where you can check out stats and info about your opponents to help your pick/ban strategy.

clashbeta_scouting.png

You'll see your opponents' win rates and KDAs with their most-played champions in ranked, their best champs in terms of mastery, and their previous Clash data, too.

CHAMP SELECT
Next up, in champ select, you'll be using the draft format you may have seen from competitive play--two ban phases, and two pick phases. Don't get caught off-guard! The team captain makes all the ban decisions for the team.

All champions are unlocked in Clash, so don't worry about figuring out that complicated three-person trade from solo queue.

Unlike regular games, not declaring or hovering a champion will lock in a random champion for you—we want you to avoid dodging where possible. Hovering a champion will lock in the same one where possible.

SUDDEN DEATH
Clash also features a ""sudden death"" mode to keep matches at a fixed length. After 60 minutes, towers will become more fragile and easy to push. By 65 minutes, structures will start to damage themselves at a fixed rate in order (towers in order, then inhibitors, then nexus turrets, then the nexus). By 70 minutes, one team will have won the game. This is considered a last resort and is very unlikely to happen, but we need to give all Clash matches a fixed maximum length.

/PAUSES AND /REMAKES
/pause and /remake are disabled in Clash. We know this isn't an ideal experience, but matches cannot be overrun or be remade to prevent extended days of play. There's a potential for griefing or trolling through abuse of these features.

TICKETS
You'll need either a Basic or Premium Ticket to enter Clash. A Basic Ticket lets you participate, but if you're confident, a Premium Ticket will offer even greater prizes. Each teammate chooses their own Ticket entry and their individual rewards scale off that. Once your Basic or Premium Ticket is set (when your full team locks in before a match), your entry can't be changed.

You can get tickets from missions, a teammate, or the store. Every two tournaments (once per theme), completing the Clash mission unlocks a ticket. A teammate can offer a ticket to anyone else on their team roster. In the store, you can purchase Basic Tickets with Blue Essence or RP, and Premium Tickets at a higher RP cost.

Tickets are a method of entry unique to Clash. We're introducing ticket entry for a couple reasons. We hope that all teams are committed to see each tournament through, and tickets are a way to keep the games high-stakes.

The only difference between Basic and Premium Tickets is the prize pool you're playing for. A Basic Ticket nets basic rewards, and a Premium Ticket upgrades your prize (read more below).

You can always go here to get your ticket!

 
PRIZES
Rewards in Clash come in three main forms: Trophies, Victory Points (VP), Orbs, and Capsules.

Winning a bracket earns you a Trophy of the corresponding tournament theme:

Clash_Trophies.jpg

Your highest-level trophy shows up at the nexus for all your Summoner's Rift games for two weeks after the tournament ends. After that, it's time to win a new one! Trophies from the current season will also display on your profile page.

VICTORY POINTS & BANNER FRAMES
Every time you win, you'll earn 400 Victory Points, which you'll use to unlock Banners. Banners are a type of reward which shows up on Summoner's Rift and in your profile.

VICTORY POINTS	REWARD
400 VP	Banner Level 1
600 VP	Theme Logo 1
1000 VP	Banner Level 2
1400 VP	Banner Level 3
2000 VP	Theme Logo 2
Demacia_Banners.jpg

Your VP scales on the tier your team plays in (higher tiers earn a first-win VP bonus) and your personal ticket entry. As you progress, your VP totals up over the Clash Weekend, and you can unlock banners and new team icons.

FIRST-WIN VP BONUS
TIER	FIRST-WIN BONUS VP REWARD
1	150 VP for the first win during a Clash day (players can get the first-win bonus once per day, each Clash day)
2	100 VP for the first win during a Clash day (players can get the first-win bonus once per day, each Clash day)
3	50 VP for the first win during a Clash day (players can get the first-win bonus once per day, each Clash day)
4	None
Remember, even if you lose, you can re-enter the next day for more chances at VP! Your VP will not persist past the theme, but you're automatically granted any rewards you meet the threshold for. Any banners you unlock will display on your Summoner's Rift games in your chosen lane. Also, as you collect banners over the course of the season, you'll upgrade the appearance of the frame that holds the banner in place.

FLAG COUNT	LEVEL	IMAGE

ORBS AND CAPSULES
blobid5.png  blobid6.png

Every player who enters into Clash will receive a Clash Orb or Clash Capsule when you exit the bracket (when you lose or end up winning the whole thing). The Orb or Capsule earned will be based on the total number of wins and losses during the tournament.

The capsule contents upgrade depending on your ticket entry and how far you get into a tournament.

It's important to note that these reward pools don't change the overall experience for Clash, so you can choose how to enter depending on how confident you're feeling.

Ranked,League of Legends College Club Program FAQ,"Thank you for your interest in the college League of Legends community! Since 2012, passionate college students have worked diligently to create local communities that come together to celebrate gaming culture and League of Legends. Find out how you can get involved!

The League of Legends Club Program
WHAT IS THE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS COLLEGE CLUB PROGRAM?
The League of Legends College Club Program (formerly uLoL) was created to support and empower League of Legends communities on college campuses all over the U.S. and Canada. These communities comprise passionate, enthusiastic students who share one thing in common: a love for League of Legends. Clubs are run by collegiate Organizers who strive to create memorable and engaging experiences for all of their members through social events, tournaments, parties, mentorship programs, and informal get-togethers. They're run by students for students; Riot simply provides support and guidance where possible.

IS THERE A LEAGUE OF LEGENDS CLUB AT MY SCHOOL?
There might be! Check your School's Club Listings to Find out

League of Legends Club Registration
HOW DO I START A CLUB?
While multiple League of Legends Clubs are allowed at one school, we encourage you to integrate yourself into an existing club if one has already been created. If you've discovered that there's no club on your campus and you believe you have what it takes to be a great Organizer, registering a League of Legends Club is simple, but there are a few things you should have ready before you start:

Identify who your fellow officers will be, and get their names and emails.
Compile basic information about your university.
If your club already exists and you are simply re-registering for a new academic year, compile your club's basic information.
(Optional) Reach out to a member of your school's faculty prior to starting the club. While this isn't a mandatory step in the registration process, a Faculty Advisor should be able to help you navigate any roadblocks that arise with your school or administration
Now that you've got all the info ready it's time to register your club via Riot's College Club Officers Discord Server.
DO I HAVE TO HAVE AN ALREADY-ESTABLISHED CLUB TO REGISTER?
Nope! In fact, registering your club is a great way to set the foundation and start growing a community at your school.

CAN I START A CLUB IF I'M NOT A FULL-TIME STUDENT AT A UNIVERSITY?
Part-time students are welcome to start a club, but you need to be registered with your university and currently attending classes.

HOW MANY OFFICERS CAN MY CLUB HAVE?
League of Legends Clubs can have up to five registered officers in the Collegiate Program. If you have a particularly large club and would like to have unofficial officers in addition to your registered five, that's fine with us!

HOW DO I UPDATE MY CLUB'S INFO?
It's normal for things like mailing addresses, club leadership, and contact information to change. It's important for you to keep your information up-to-date to ensure we're able to contact you if necessary, so reach out to the admins in the College Club Officers Discord server whenever you need to make a change!

DO I HAVE TO REGISTER MY CLUB EVERY YEAR?
We start off every academic year with a blank slate, so you'll need you to register your officers even if they're the same as last year. If none of your club info has changed, registration should be a breeze!

CAN I REGISTER MY SCHOOL IF IT IS LOCATED IN A COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND CANADA?
If you're from a country outside of the NA Region, please submit a support ticket and we'll do our best to get you in touch with someone from your region. Just keep in mind that each region runs their collegiate program a little differently.

CAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REGISTER A CLUB?
Right now registration is just for college communities, and we're not supporting high school clubs in the same way.

 

Additional Information
CAN RIOT CREATE CUSTOM ART OR SWAG FOR MY CLUB OR SCHOOL?
Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate these kinds of requests due to the sheer number of schools that participate in the League of Legends College Club Program.

CAN I USE THE RIOT LOGO ON A FLYER/BANNER/SOCIAL MEDIA SITE?
Riot does not sponsor collegiate events, so please refrain from using the Riot logo on any art assets you own or create. If you would like to brand your event/club, you are welcome to use the League of Legends logo—we only ask that you please not alter it in any way.

DO COLLEGIATE CLUBS GET A DISCOUNT AT THE MERCH STORE?
Club members and organizers do not receive a discount in the Merch Store.

DOES RIOT FROWN UPON COLLEGIATE CLUBS PARTNERING WITH A 3RD PARTY ORGANIZATIONS?
Not at all! Riot does not own or directly manage any League of Legends College Clubs, so if you would like to partner with a 3rd party organization, feel free!

CAN RIOT SPONSOR OUR EVENT?
Unfortunately, no. While we may offer support, this does not mean that your event is sponsored by Riot. Please refrain from advertising Riot Games as an official sponsor for your event.

CAN RIOT DONATE SWAG OR PROMOTE OUR EVENT?
At the present time we do not have a program in place to support requests for swag, physical merch, or similar requests.

CAN A RIOT REPRESENTATIVE SPEAK OR HOST A BOOTH AT OUR EVENT?
This is something we may consider on a case-by-case basis, but please know that it's not something we typically do. Thousands of Collegiate events happen every year, and there just aren't enough Rioters to attend them all.

CAN I VISIT RIOT HQ?
While we would love to meet all of our Organizers, we unfortunately cannot meet with players on an ad hoc basis.

MY QUESTION WASN'T COVERED IN THE FAQ. HOW DO I GET HELP?

Ranked,"MMR, Rank, and LP","Finding the right spot on the ladder for every League of Legends player is a complicated affair. While we've done our best to boil it down to simple tiers and divisions, the question remains: how does the game determine which tier you belong in?

To understand the answer, we must look to the number that holds it all together: MMR.

MMR
Your Matchmaking Rating (MMR) is what Riot uses to determine your place on the ladder and match you up with similarly skilled players. Win, and it goes up! Lose, and it goes down. Which probably leaves you wondering...

WHAT'S MY MMR?
Your MMR is...a secret!

MMR has been custom-tailored to work with the backend systems that help place you into fair games. Removing it from these systems strips away a lot of its context, making it less useful to players as a hard indicator of skill. That's why we've created another system to help translate your hidden MMR into a more relatable format: ranks.

MMR VS RANK
If MMR is your overall skill level, rank is a fluid representation of your current position on the path to fulfilling that potential. It helps contextualize where you are on the ladder relative to other players, and also offers meaningful progression in the form of tiers and divisions.

The interplay between your MMR and your rank may be hidden, but the results can be seen through another system that ranked players are intimately familiar with: LP

LP
League Points (LP) are how you move through the ranks. They are rewarded for victory and deducted upon defeat. You generally need 100 LP to climb up each division, though there are other rules governing your progression that you can read about in our article on placements, promos, and more.

They're also how we bridge the gap between your MMR and your rank, which can result in big differences between how much LP you gain or lose each game.

To get a better idea of how your MMR and rank can affect your seasonal climb, check out the video below.


Still not sure how it all works? Read on for more details!

ABOUT EQUAL LP GAINS/LOSSES : MMR = RANK
If you are winning about the same amount of LP in victory as you lose in defeat, that means your MMR and rank are just about even. In other words, the system has determined your current rank is an accurate reflection of your skill level.

Want to prove the system wrong? Then just keep winning more than you lose! Both your MMR and your rank will rise with each victory, ensuring a slow and steady climb. Just be cautious when using your overall win rate to assess your climbing potential! If you're at 55% win rate after a steady climb through a few hundred games but your LP gains are slowing down, that likely means you had a higher win rate earlier in your climb and something closer to 50% at your current position.

If you're looking for a quick ascent, then you're gonna have to turn up the heat.

BIGGER LP GAINS, SMALLER LP LOSSES : MMR > RANK
When your MMR is significantly higher than your rank, the system will attempt to push you up to your rightful position on the ladder with greater LP rewards upon victory and smaller deductions upon defeat. This will almost always happen at the start of each new ranked season, as you'll begin your climb at a lower rank than you ended it last season. Your MMR, however, remains at exactly the same spot, so winning will push you quickly through the ranks!

Once your MMR and rank have equalized, however, you'll begin to see smaller LP gains and bigger losses until the two are about the same. At that point, you'll need to win a ton of games in a row to signal to the system that you belong in a higher rank. Win enough, and you'll start getting bigger LP rewards to help you reach your true rank more quickly. This will continue until your wins and losses begin to even out, at which point the system determines you've hit the appropriate rank and LP gains/losses will equalize.

SMALLER LP GAINS, BIGGER LP LOSES : MMR < RANK
Though we try our best to give both teams about a 50% chance of winning every game, your win record may not reflect that. And that's okay! There are lots of reasons you might find yourself on a cold streak. Maybe you've been trying a new champ or position, you're rusty after taking a long break, or it's just plain old bad luck.

Whatever the case, getting multiple losses in a row signals to our system that your rank and MMR are no longer in sync. In an effort to fix this disparity, you'll lose more LP each defeat until your winrate levels out.

If you find yourself in this situation, consider taking a break or switching to a more comfortable champion.

CONSOLATION LP (AFK/LEAVING/INTENTIONALLY FEEDING TEAMMATES)
Losing because one of your teammates goes AFK, leaves the game, or runs it down mid to feed the enemy, stinks. Not only does it feel bad, but it also alters your rank in a way that just isn't fair. That's why we may award consolation LP for players in this situation, provided the following conditions are met:

You're on the losing team
You lost LP (you won't be given Consolation LP if you're at 0 LP in division IV of your tier)
Another player on your team was reported and verified for AFK/Leaving/Intentional Feeding that game
The disruptive player is NOT part of your premade group
If you check all the above boxes, watch your LP animation after the game and you should see a little Consolation LP boost! Just note that you can only be awarded so much Consolation LP each week, so if you're experiencing an unusually bad streak of 4v5s, it might not hurt to consider taking a short break.

Disruptive behavior outside of Ranked is also punished and affected players are compensated, but it varies in these games since there is no LP to gain/lose. Learn more about Disruptive Behavior Repair.

OTHER REASONS LP MAY VARY
There are a few other reasons your LP gains/losses may deviate from their standard numbers:

A system-wide issue triggers loss-prevention, which also caps LP gains
AFK/Leaver penalties can reduce your LP not only for the game you went AFK in, but also for the game after
You have larger or smaller than average odds of winning a single game due to rank disparities on one or both teams or other advantages/disadvantages
No matter what the situation, we always aim to make the amount of LP you gain or lose feel fair.

QUEUES & MODES
In order to accurately reflect the unique expectations of each queue, you have a different MMR for Normal, Solo/Duo, and Flex. That means you don't have to worry about a rough streak of losses in Flex altering your Solo/Duo MMR, though your initial placement in Ranked will take your Normal MMR into consideration!.

QUEUING WITH FRIENDS
Forming a party and jumping into ranked with friends is a great way to test your skills along with your friendships, but it also changes the way matchmaking works. Queueing with somebody you know confers certain advantages that the system takes into account when creating your games, so you may see slightly more difficult opponents or reduced LP gains.

Ranked,"Ranked Tiers, Divisions, and Queues","From the slums of Zaun to the peak of Targon, Runeterra holds a tremendous gradient of people and places. And in a lot of ways, League is no different! Whether you're a weekend warrior or dial in daily, there's a place for you on the Rift.

But that still begs the question: where exactly do you fall on that spectrum? To find out, you'll have to learn about tiers and divisions!

Tiers & Divisions
Fairness and progression are the heart of competitive play. So in order to ensure fair matches and provide goals for ambitious players, we created a system that translates the chaos of individual league matches into a more structured path—a path consisting of tiers and divisions.

TIERS
Instead of a single towering summit, it's helpful to visualize the many tiers of Ranked as a sprawling mountain range. Each peak conquered is a triumph!

Tiers.jpg

Ranked players are divided into ten tiers, shown above in ascending order. Each one houses players of similar skill levels and follows a simple rule: the more you win, the higher you'll climb!

But tiers can only tell you so much. After all, the player who just broke out of Silver probably won't be on the same level as the one on the cusp of Diamond glory, so how do you tell the difference between a couple of Golds?

Divisions, that's how!

DIVISIONS
Each tier is more than a destination—it's a journey, and divisions are your stops along the way. 

divisions.jpg

Tiers Iron through Diamond each have four divisions. You must complete one division to reach the next, and will usually start in the lowest division upon reaching a new tier. If you're in Silver III, for example, you'll have to climb through Silver II and Silver I before breaking through to Gold IV!

Should you have the misfortune of dropping a tier (it happens to the best of us!), then you'll start in the highest division of the next tier down. In the example above, perhaps you've hit a cold streak after hitting Gold IV. Lose enough games, and you'll drop to Silver I.

There are, of course, plenty of exceptions and extra complexity to how this climb works, which you can read up on by visiting our article on placements, promos, and more!

MASTER, GRANDMASTER, AND CHALLENGER
If you've hit Master, whoa. Nice work! You're in the top .2% of players worldwide, and that's no small feat!

But that also means you're climbing with a special set of rules created to accommodate the heightened stakes of top-tier play, which you can find on our page about Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger!

Queues
Ranked is divided into two different queues, each with its own purpose and set of restrictions.

SOLO/DUO
If your motto is “win lane, win game,"" then this is the queue for you. Whether you jump in alone or with a friend, Solo/Duo is the best place to test your mechanics, game sense, and on-the-fly communication with like-minded individuals. Nobody you meet in Solo/Duo queue will be grouped with more than one other person, so each game is an opportunity to coordinate with fresh allies against a new batch of foes.

Your rank in Solo/Duo queue is totally independent of your rank in Flex, and you’ll earn rewards unique to your Solo tier at the end of the season.

RESTRICTIONS
duo queue restrictions jpeg.jpg

Since Solo/Duo is more focused on individual performance, there are limitations on who you can queue with.

IRON—MASTER
Most players can queue with friends within one tier of their rank, but these restrictions start a little loose at lower ranks and get tighter the higher you go. For example, Iron players can queue with players up to two tiers their senior! But ascend to Diamond, and your buddy must be within two divisions to join your party. If you hit Master, you can duo with only Diamond I and other Master players. 

GRANDMASTER+
Reaching Grandmaster tier is a tremendous accomplishment, but it's also the start of a whole new journey where only the best can ascend. That's why players in Grandmaster or higher must queue alone. There's only room for one at the top!

GRANDMASTER+ MMR RESTRICTIONS
In the interest of fairness, players with an MMR of Grandmaster or higher will be subject to the same solo-only restrictions regardless of rank.

FLEX
If Solo/Duo queue is all about personal progression, Flex is the soul of teamwork. It's the best place to try out unconventional comps, practice team fights, and prepare for Clash.

Your rank in Flex queue is totally independent of your rank in Solo, and you’ll earn rewards unique to your Flex tier at the end of the season.

RESTRICTIONS
flex-queue-restrictions.jpg

Like its name, Flex bends the rank restrictions quite a bit more than Solo/Duo. In fact, there are no Flex rank restrictions for Diamond and below! If you want to play with Masters and up, however, you'll have to be at least Emerald.

Additionally, the restrictions on party size are a little different.

Flex is meant to foster an atmosphere of teamwork, and creating scenarios where a single player is the odd man out interferes with that mission. So while you can queue for Flex in groups of 1, 2, 3, and 5, parties of 4 will have to stick to unranked matches.

We should also note that creating parties with large rank disparities (eg. an Iron player grouping with a Diamond player) may result in more difficult matchups as the system attempts to balance out the difference in skill levels. Flex restrictions may be more lax, but the competition is just as fierce!"
Ranked,"Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger: The Apex Tiers","Welcome to the top of the food chain. To reach any of the top three ranked tiers in League of Legends is an incredible accomplishment and proves without a doubt you're among the best players in the world. 

Master ➟	Grandmaster ➟	Challenger

This guide will summarize everything you need to know about the Apex tiers including promotion, demotion, decay, and other expectations. Some of this information also applies to the other Ranked tiers, so check out these articles to learn more about the following:

Ranked Queues
MMR & LP
Matchmaking
Seasons, Splits, & End-of-Season Rewards
Key Differences for Apex Players
With < 1% of players ever reaching this level of competitive gameplay, the rules and systems in place are a bit different for Apex ranks. 

For starters, Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger tiers are a single division league. Once you climb into Master, it’s you versus every Apex ranked player in town. Players can reach Master by way of Solo/Duo or Flex queue, but there are a few important changes to know once you get there.

SOLO QUEUE LIMITATIONS
Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger players can only queue up alone for ranked solo/duo queue. 

FLEX QUEUE LIMITATIONS
Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger players can play Flex queue solo, duo, or in teams of 3 or 5. You cannot, however, queue with any player ranked below Emerald.

Apex Rank Decay & Banked Days
The Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger tiers are all subject to rank decay, which is a -75 LP per-day penalty against inactivity. Apex players can prevent decay by playing games and earning banked days.

Master players who decay due to inactivity will descend into Diamond II, not Platinum I, and will restart their climb from there.

Banked days are how many decay events can pass before you start losing LP (with 1 decay event happening each night). You can see how many banked days you have in the Ranked tab of your in-client Player Profile.

Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger players bank 1 day per 1 game played and can bank a maximum of 14 days at a time. On top of needing to meet the LP requirements mentioned below, this means most Apex players are playing ranked games nearly every day to maintain their position.  

FOR EXAMPLE
If an Apex player has 0 banked days and is about to go on a 2 week vacation, they’ll have to play 14 ranked games the day before they leave in order to earn the 14 banked days that will protect their LP from decay while they’re gone.
Please note that rank decay still occurs even when your account is banned!

IMPORTANT
Decay is cycled one last time on the final day of the season (decay happens at 11:45 p.m., then season ends at 12:00 a.m., for example), so we recommend having at least 1 more banked day than there are days remaining in the season.

Apex Promotion, Demotion, and LP Requirements
Unlike the non-Apex tiers, movement between Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger is much more fluid, with players moving up and down between them on a daily basis. Once you reach Master, your goal is to keep winning games and collect enough LP to overtake other Apex players, while meeting the tier and regional requirements needed to climb. 

The Grandmaster and Challenger Tier standings refresh on a rotating twenty-four hour schedule. Each time the clock hits zero (local time), it recalculates all Master+ players in the same region and reorders them based on who’s met the requirements described below.

There's no upper limit on LP. Players that continue winning will keep earning LP and increase their lead in the standings. You can see the latest MMR leaderboards for your region in the Ranked tab of your in-client Player Profile.

Master Tier Promotion & Demotion
Promote by reaching 100 LP; you’re protected from demotion for your first three games.

Demote by reaching 0 LP and losing again; you’ll start in Diamond I at 50 LP.

When you first enter Master, you’re protected from losses and cannot be removed for your first three games. Please note that rank decay happens separate from this—you can still demote due to inactivity!

Grandmaster Tier Promotion & Demotion
Promote by reaching 200 LP and gaining more LP than the lowest Grandmaster player in your region.

Demote by falling below 200 LP or by losing more LP than the lowest Grandmaster player in your region.

Challenger Tier Promotion & Demotion
Promote by reaching 500 LP and gaining more LP than the lowest Challenger player in your region.

Demote by falling below 500 LP or by losing more LP than the lowest Challenger player in your region."
Ranked,Matchmaking and Autofill,"Matchmaking
In an ideal world, every match would include ten individuals with identical MMRs queuing at the same time, each having selected a unique position that they're well-suited for.

But reality is a bit more complicated.

That's why our matchmaking system focuses on balancing three things each time you queue up:

Fair Matches
Position Preferences
Quick Queues
FAIR MATCHES
To the matchmaker, a “fair” match is one where each team has a 50% +/-1% chance of winning, which we create by pairing off teams of roughly the same average MMR. Further down we'll get into some of the challenges that can complicate this process, but we aim for no more than a 4–5 MMR gap between the averages of both teams in the majority of games..

POSITION PREFERENCE
Before queuing up for Ranked, every player must list two preferred positions (unless you choose ""Fill,"" you absolute legend). We'll always try to prioritize your Primary position, but your Secondary position may be used as a backup depending on matchmaking conditions.

However, neither preference is guaranteed. In the event we can't find a full team comp at your skill level, there's a small chance you will be Autofilled. This generally happens when your queue time gets too long, which is usually because there's a shortage of one or more positions in the queue. We consider this a last resort to get you out of the lobby and into a game.

QUICK QUEUES
Creating fair matches is one of League's top priorities, but we also respect your time and recognize how frustrating a long queue can be. After all, you're here to play—not to wait.

If your queue time is running long, that means the system is having trouble finding an appropriate match up. The longer you wait, the more the matchmaking system may stray from your MMR or swap someone's position—though we'll still try to keep things as fair as possible.

Matchmaking Challenges
While we strive for fairness, preference, and speed, there are plenty of factors that can complicate those goals:

Matches played during off-peak hours (smaller selection pool)
Parties of players with very different MMRs (harder to average and match)
A shortage of one or more positions (sometimes resulting in one or more players being autofilled)
These all throw curveballs at the matchmaker, forcing it to weigh one aspect more heavily than the others.

Even then, there can be other hidden elements that make a seemingly fair match feel a little unbalanced:

One or more players trying an off-position
One or more players trying an unfamiliar champion
An otherwise fair match in which one lane has an unfair matchup
A few key kills early on cause a game to snowball out of control
Sometimes, players just have bad games!
Your playstyles as a team just aren't meshing
Of course, the enemy team could potentially have all the same issues, so stay focused and always give it your best! Especially when facing...

HIGH-RANK OPPONENTS
It's one thing to feel a match is unbalanced, but another to actually play against opponents who are a few divisions—or even a tier!—above you.

But there are plenty of good reasons this may be happening!

YOU'RE WINNING A LOT!
If you're being consistently placed against opponents who are a higher rank than you, then congratulations! That could mean the matchmaker is starting to suspect you're worthy of higher placement. If you're on a big win streak, you may even start to see opponents several divisions your senior!

YOUR OPPONENT IS LOSING A LOT
Alas, balancing goes both ways. The matchmaker is placing them against lower-ranked opponents to find them an appropriate spot on the ladder.

LARGE RANK DISPARITY WITHIN A TEAM
While the average MMR for both teams will still be roughly the same, ensuring a fair match becomes more challenging if one team has five teammates of roughly equal skill and the other team has a mix of low and high ranked players. Thankfully, this rarely happens outside of premade teams in Flex queue.

That being said, the same phenomenon can happen in Solo/Duo queue when two players with a big rank gap (Bronze IV and Silver I, for instance) queue up together. But don't worry! You have one weapon your enemies may not—THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP.

...Seriously, though! Make sure you take advantage of your duo queue with better planning, coordinating, and communication to stack the odds in your favor.

Autofill
If you've ever played a game and gotten a position you didn't select, you've been autofilled. This usually happens when a position is low in supply during matchmaking, and it can happen for any position. The goal of autofill is to keep queue times reasonable and matchmaking fair.

REDUCING AUTOFILL
Before we move on, let's be clear: there's no way to completely avoid autofilling.

That's why we recommend every player familiarize themselves with at least one champion in each position. In fact, this is good advice in general—you might be less inclined to flame your jungler if you've spent a few games missing your own smites.

The second-best way to manage autofill is to take fate into your own hands and fill or select an autofill-protected position. Since position popularity varies by region and can shift over time, we can't definitively state which positions will be eligible for autofill. However! You can always check when you queue up by looking for the following messages below your preferred position selections:

autofill-protected.png AUTOFILL PROTECTED autofill-protected.png
A position you've selected is short on players, so you'll be guaranteed to get one of your top two choices. You're helping bring balance to the Rift!

autofill-enabled.png AUTOFILL ACTIVATED autofill-enabled.png
The positions you've selected are in high demand, so you may be autofilled. Such is the price of popularity!

Remember, autofill only activates when at least one position desperately needs players. Each time you fill, you're lightening the burden on everyone and reducing their chances of being autofilled. It's a quiet heroism, but heroism nonetheless, and it may even prevent one of your teammates from getting autofilled into one of their weaker positions.

And if you do end up autofilled after queueing for a different position, hunker down and give it your best shot knowing that you'll be guaranteed your primary or secondary position in the next handful of games.

Some final notes:

If you or someone else dodges from an autofilled lobby, you will not be protected from autofill for the next game.
/remake-ing a match will count against any autofill protection you may have stored up. We're sorry for the inconvenience."
Ranked,"Placements, Promotions, Series, Demotions, and Decay","When you queue up for Ranked, it's important to know what's at stake. Sure, every win and loss will affect your MMR, but climbing—or even falling!—between tiers might also be on the line. As might be your starting position on the ladder!

Placements
Placement matches are how we determine your starting position on the current season or split's Ranked ladder. You'll only play them if you're unranked, which happens if you've never played Ranked before or if it's the start of a new season/split.

You'll have to play five placement matches in each Ranked queue to lock in your starting tier/division, which will depend on the outcome of these matches, the difficulty of the opponents you faced, and your rank from the previous season and preseason. If you participated in Ranked last season/split, know that all players undergo a 'soft reset' at the beginning of each season/split, so your new rank will likely be about a tier lower than it was at the end of the previous season/split. If you've never played Ranked before, your normal MMR will be taken into account for your placement matches. You also cannot place any higher than Diamond III, even if you were previously in one of the top tiers.

You cannot lose League Points (LP) in placement matches! Instead, you'll simply gain 0 LP upon defeat. But be sure to play with a good connection, as going AFK will also count as a loss in your placements.

Promotions
Once you're placed in a division, you'll earn LP for each match you win and lose LP for each match you lose. Breaking 100 LP within a division will promote you to the next division of your current tier. You'll even hang on to any leftover LP!

If you accrue 100 LP in division I of any tier (like Iron I, Emerald I, etc), you'll automatically move into the next tier. It's as simple as that!

Of course, what can be won can also be lost...

Demotions and Decay
Winning is the only path to promotion, but there are two ways to drop below your current division and tier: demotions and decay. 

DEMOTIONS
Demoting between divisions within a tier (ie. Silver III to Silver IV) happens whenever you lose more LP than you have. For example, if you're at 5 LP in Silver III and lose 20 LP in a game, you'll be demoted to Silver IV with 85 LP.

If you're in division IV, however, you'll generally be able to lose several matches before being demoted to the next tier down. Just how many losses it'll take depends on your MMR, so the best way to tell whether you're in danger of demotion is by checking your Ranked emblem under the Ranked tab. A yellow warning icon indicates that you're approaching demotion, while a red icon means demotion is imminent. If you still lose at this point, you'll fall to the top division of the tier below (ie. Silver IV to Bronze I), and your LP will be set to 25, 50, or 75 LP depending on your MMR.

DEMOTION SHIELD
Just get promoted to a new tier and now you’re worried about dropping right back down with a loss or two? Don’t be! Up through Diamond, you’ll be protected from demotion for your first few games.
For information on how demotion shields work at Master and higher, read our article on the apex tiers.

APEX TIER DEMOTIONS
Just like promotions, demotions for players Master and higher are a little different. Check out our article on the apex tiers to learn everything you need to know!

DECAY
Decay only occurs for players in Diamond and up, so if you're in Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Emerald, feel free to skip this section!

Reaching the top tiers of League is just the first step. If you want to keep your position, you'll have to fight for it. Let too many days go by without a match in that queue, and decay will set in, causing you to automatically lose a set amount of LP each day.

But that doesn't mean you have to play every day. When you enter a division with decay (ie. Diamond+), you’ll be given a number of banked days. At the end of each day, your number of banked days will decrease by one. Once you run out of banked days, you’ll lose LP instead. 

You can earn more banked days by playing matches, but how many days you earn per match (and how much LP you lose if you decay) differs by rank:

DIAMOND TIER
Banked Days per Match: 7
Maximum Banked Days: 28
Initial Days Before Decay: 28
LP Lost on Decay: 50
MASTER, GRANDMASTER, AND CHALLENGER TIERS
Banked Days per Match: 1
Maximum Banked Days: 14
Initial Days Before Decay: 14
LP Lost on Decay: 75
If you fall to or below 0 LP as a result of decay, you'll be placed in the next-lowest division. If you're already in division IV of your tier, you'll fall into the next tier down (ie. Diamond IV to Emerald I). However, Apex Tier players who decay due to inactivity will descend into Diamond II and restart their climb from there.

Also note that decay will still activate even when you're banned, so protect your hard-earned spot on the ladder by playing with apex-tier sportsmanship!"
Ranked,"Ranked Seasons, Splits, and End-of-Split Rewards","Seasons
League of Legends has annual Ranked seasons divided into three splits to help you track your Ranked journey and regularly reward your efforts.

The first split starts in January, second begins in May, and the third in September. You'll begin each new split unranked, but you can jump back on the ladder by playing ten placement games. Once those are finished, you should find yourself at just about a full tier below your final rank the previous split, though results may vary depending on your performance in your placement games and in the preseason.

Also note that the highest you can begin a new split is at Emerald I. If you wanna climb higher, you gotta earn it!

While proving yourself on the Ranked ladder is its own reward, you'll also be granted prizes along the way—especially at the end of each split!

REGALIA
Ranked Regalia—the visual representation of the ranks you earn throughout a season—comes in two flavors: Crests and loading screen borders.

Crests display your current rank and appear on your profile, the loading screen, and as an optional border to your Summoner icon in the pre-game lobby. 

Loading screen borders display your current rank for the queue you're in (in normals, this is your highest Summoner's Rift rank). You'll also be able to click players in the loading screen to see more information about their ranked status and champion mastery.

VICTORIOUS SKINS
Victorious_Lucian.JPG

Starting with Season 2023, you can earn Victorious skins just by playing Ranked, earning Split Points, and reaching at least Honor Level 2! How many games you'll have to play/win, however, depends on your rank.

If you're Iron, Bronze, or Silver, you'll need 1000 Split Points for that split's Victorious skin.

If you're Gold or higher, then you'll only need 80 Split Points. (Note that this is true only while you're Gold or higher! If you demote before unlocking the skin, your goalposts will be shifted to 1000 Split Points)

victorious-skin-progress.png

If you're not sure where you stand, hover over the above icon in your Ranked page to see how close you are to getting that split's Victorious skin.

This makes it possible for any player to get a Victorious skin! Just remember: your Victorious skin chromas will be based on your final rank for that split, so there's always a good reason to test your limits and see just how high you can go!

WHAT IF I UNLOCK THE SKIN WHILE I'M GOLD+, BUT THEN I DEMOTE DOWN TO SILVER?
Don't worry! Once you've unlocked the Victorious skin for your split, you'll keep it even if you are demoted. Just make sure you've unlocked it first! If you start in Gold but are demoted before reaching 80 Split Points, your goalposts will be shifted to 1000 Split Points.

HONOR REWARDS
You'll get some rewards just for reaching honor level 3 or higher, but the exclusive Three Honors skinline will only grace those whose exceptional sportsmanship has brought them to honor Level 5 by the end of the season

END OF SPLIT INFO
As the end of each split approaches, you can learn what you stand to win on both the League of Legends website and in our End of Season articles. This information usually drops about a month before the end of each split, so stay on the lookout!

Splits
Seasons are divided into three splits, during which you can earn Split Points by playing Ranked games. Earn enough Points, and you'll instantly unlock the rewards shown in the Split Progress Bar at the bottom of your Ranked page. 

SPLIT POINTS
Starting with Season 2023, we've simplified how you earn Split Points. You'll still need to queue up in either Ranked Solo/Duo or Flex, but you'll get 10 Split Points per victory and 6 Split Points per loss.

Transfers and Ranked Placement/Rewards
Ranked standing is unique on each server, so you'll need to play a new set of placement games after transferring. Your placement is also based on your current MMR (which transfers with you) relative to the MMR of everyone on that server, which means you may end up in a different tier or division than your original server.

Additionally, your old rank on your original server will be lost if you don't return within two weeks. If you decide to switch back after that, you'll have to start the process from the beginning, placement matches and all.

For more information on what does or does not come with you between servers, refer to our guide on account transfers."
Ranked,Queue Dodging,"Every time you hit the Play button, you’re entering an unspoken agreement with nine other players to set aside the next hour or so for some good ol’ fashioned League shenanigans. The closer it gets to game time, the greater that commitment becomes. And while we’d rather players not leave during Champ Select, we get it. Life happens! But whether you’re handling an emergency or you just can’t bear facing Teemo again after a string of brutal mushroom-related defeats, the penalties for queue dodging are always the same, and you should know what you’re getting into.

Queue dodging happens when a player in champion select decides to leave the lobby for any reason. When one player dodges, the remaining players on both teams are placed back into the matchmaking queue and the leaving player suffers a penalty depending on the game queue they are currently in. Please find the list of penalties below:

Penalties
Queue	1 Dodge	2 Dodges	3+ Dodges
Solo/Flex Ranked Queue	
6 minute queue penalty
-5 LP
30 minute queue penalty
-15 LP
720 minute (12 hours) queue penalty
-15 LP
Classic (Normal) Queue	
6 minute queue penalty
30 minute queue penalty
720 minute (12 hours) queue penalty
ARAM Queue	
15 minute queue penalty
Lose all used rerolls
30 minute queue penalty
Lose all used rerolls
720 minute (12 hours) queue penalty
Lose all used rerolls
 

Your dodge-penalty tier will automatically decrease by one tier every 12 hours. 

Dodging in any promotional series will count as a loss.

If you dodge the final game of a series, it will count as a loss and the series will end.

If a player dodges in a normal game and then dodges in a ranked game, the penalty for the ranked dodge will be the same as if there were two dodges.

If you dodge in ARAM, you will not be refunded any of the rerolls you used in the game.

If you're in an ARAM game where somebody else dodges, your spent rerolls for that game will be refunded.

Failing to 'lock in' pick/ban in the Solo/Flex Ranked Queue will result in a dodge.

You will lose LP in any positions for which you've already placed.

READY CHECK AND RANKED GAMES
When a matchmaking system finds suitable opponents, all participating players will be subject to a ""Ready Check"" where they must confirm their availability. In order to prevent abuse, missing a Ready Check too many times results in a timed queue ban, as well as an LP loss in Ranked queues. The exact penalties are described below:

Declining or missing the Ready Check too many times in a Ranked queue will result in a 6 minute ban from all queues and a loss of 5 LP.
The penalty is increased to 15 LP for continuing to miss Ready Checks.
Each subsequent miss increases the length of the timed queue ban and imposes a 10 LP penalty.
Ready Checks penalties from any queue affects the entire account. This means that penalties from normal queues will carry over to Ranked queues and may result in harsher penalties."
Ranked,Loss Prevented,"Loss Prevention is feature of League of Legends that forgives a loss a player receives outside of their control.  When an issue affects a large number of players all at once, a compensation mode is activated which enables loss prevention.

WHAT IS COMPENSATION MODE?
This mode is activated when League of Legends experiences server- or system-wide issues. It essentially tries to prevent players from being punished for reasons outside of their control.

Once it is active, the following rules apply:

Players will not receive a loss or a leave.
Players will not lose League Points (LP) or MMR.
Players will still receive a win at a 50% rate for LP/MMR gains.
Players will not receive a loss if they are in the middle of their promo series.
Players will receive all of the earned XP for the game.
Stats will be recorded and saved for games, but they will not apply for any lifetime totals.
 

HOW DOES THIS MODE ACTIVATE?
This mode only activates when a large number of players are being impacted on a system-wide scale. We hit something we call ""The Button"" to activate it for the platform. Compensation Mode cannot be retroactively enabled or turned on for a player on an individual basis.

 

WHAT DOES HITTING ""THE BUTTON"" MEAN?
This means that we've activated Compensation Mode. All impacted games will be marked with a Loss Prevented.

 

WHAT DOES A LOSS PREVENTED LOOK LIKE?
When you view your match history, the impacted game will be marked in red with Loss Prevented.

General,Guide,"So you want to play League of Legends?

Below is going to be a lot of information, but I will be keeping it semi-simple. There is a LOT to learn, and even after learning the basics, there's still so much that varies from champion to champion and item to item. 

Roles and Lanes
Games are 5v5, and there are 5 different roles per team.
Top: Of course it is the person in the toplane.
Middle: The person in the middle lane of the map.
Jungle: The person that roams throughout the jungles between lanes.
Bottom: They are in the bottom lane
Support: Is in the bottom lane as well
General overview of roles, not in depth:
Top: Taking towers, being tanky, and being the frontline of the team.
Mid: More mobile, high damage.
Jungle: Taking objectives that spawn, Dragons, Baron, Rift, etc Ganking lanes.
Bot: Is also called the ADC (Attack Damage Carry) They want to deal a lot of damage and kill the enemy.
Sup: Puts down wards and clears enemy wards, helps their ADC and team.Think: Healing, Shielding, etc. 
The goal is to destroy the enemy's buildings. The buildings being Towers, Inhibitors, and the main unit, their Nexus in their base. The first team to blow up the enemy Nexus, wins. 
In LOL, you need to level up, gain gold, and buy items to become stronger. 
The Map
This is Summoners Rift, AKA, the map you play on. The labels of where the different lanes are, and where the roles go.


The map has a Blue side, and Red side, as seen in the image below. You are either on the Blue or Red team, and listed below are the Towers, Inhibitors, and the Nexus for each team. As well as where the major Jungle Objectives (Dragons, Rift, Baron) spawn.  



There are different Jungle Plants around the map that spawn, attacking them does different things:
 
Scryers Bloom: Attack to release pollen in a cone shape that reveals enemies and wards.
Blast Cone: Attack while near to explode the plant. This can send you over walls.
Honeyfruit: Attack to drop 5 fruits that restore Health and Mana



NEW: The Map has changed in some areas. I don't have a full image yet, but will update that when it arrives. 


Game Modes: 
The main modes are Draft Pick and Ranked SoloDuo

Ranked is of course, Ranked, with different ranks from Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc Ranked uses the Draft format as described below. 
Normal, is just the game but it doesn't affect your rank.
Blinds, just means that when everyone loads into a game, you type in the role that you want.
QuickPlay, you will Select 2 Champions, and 2 Roles, the game will automatically have you join a game. 
When you play Draft, you select 2 roles you want, and it gives everyone a role, and you take turns selecting champs. Each person gets to Ban a champion, and no one can play them.
ARAM, means All Random All Mid, and is a fun game mode just to play here and there, same with TFT, TeamFight Tactics, that is a board game like game.
Arena, is a 2v2v2v2, so 4 teams of 2 people. And you fight it out in, well, an Arena. 
As you can see:

Summoner Spells and Runes:

Once you queue up for a game, you are going to select a lane, a champion to play, and their Runes and Summoner Spells, as well as any Skins or Chromas. 

Summoner Spells are these guys right here, and they are very important. They are bound to the F and D keys on your computer by default. They are each different, and serve a different purpose, and generally depending on your Lane, you are going to need specific ones. 



Flash (the most popular, almost everyone needs it) 
Flash causes your champion to teleport or blink, a short distance in the direction of the cursor. Great for escaping, and getting closer to your enemy, or going over walls. 

Heal (generally champs in the Botlane take this)
Heal instantly restores health to your champion and an ally while also granting a small burst of movement speed.

Ghost (Champion specific, not super super common)
Ghost increases your champions movement speed and grants them the ability to move through minions.

Barrier (Champion specific, not super super common)
Barrier shields your champion from damage for a few seconds.

Exhaust (Generally taken by Botlaners)
Exhaust slows an enemy champion, and reduces their damage dealt for a few seconds.

Teleport (Generally taken by Top lane, but also Mid and Occasionally Bot)
Teleport, well, teleports you to the target allied unit after a few seconds of channeling. Pre-14 minutes you can teleport to towers. After 10 minutes, it can be an allied unit (wards, boxes, minions, etc)

Smite (A must have for Jungler)
Smite deals true damage to the target large or medium monster, enemy minion, or pet. More on this later. 

Cleanse (Champion specific, not super super common)
Cleanse removes most crowd control effects and summoner spell debuffs

Ignite (Generally taken by Supports, Mid, and Top laners)
Ignite deals True Damage over the duration and applies Healing Reduction as well as granting True Sight of the enemy. 

You will have to select them after you select your champion, along with your Runes: 

Runes are, well, a lot to learn. I can't teach you much, except it takes time to see which ones go on certain champs. This is a screenshot, and there are a lot, each is good and bad for certain champs.

The game automatically give you 3 recommended Runes Pages so just go with one of those until you learn more. They are complex, and in time you will learn how to pick them for matchups and your build. 



After selecting your Champion, Runes, and Skin,and Ward Skin, the match is about to start. Reminder: Skins don't affect the game at all, it's just how you look. 


Game Start: 
Now the game starts. When starting, you have 500 Gold. You will purchase your starting items. Again, this depends on your champion, and lane, so I can't give you the exact item to buy. But you can do some looking, asking, see builds, etc. There's over 200 items possibly? There's a LOT. 

I will add, generally, these are the starting items per role: 

TOP - Doran's Shield or Dorans Blade
MID -  Doran’s Ring / Blade and Potions
JUNGLE - One of the 3 Eggs, and a potion. 
ADC - Doran's Blade
SUP - World Atlus, it's a Support item.

This looks confusing, but don't worry, it's actually pretty simple. If you are new, just go with what the game recommends. 




When you start, you are of course Level 1, and you can choose one Ability to upgrade. Every level up allows you to upgrade an ability so you can use it, or upgrade one that you have to make it stats better.

As you can see below, the Green bar is your Health. 
The Blue bar is your Mana. 
The number next to your image is your level. 
On the right are your 6 item slots for buying items and your Gold. 

Mana is used to cast your Abilities. Some champions have Energy instead, some do not require Mana, but most of the champs are going to use Mana for abilities. 


 

Now, after buying an item (you can only buy items when you are in your base) depending on which lane you chose, that is where you will go. Top, Mid, Jungle, Bot/ADC, and Sup based off the map above. When waiting for the match to start, you can wait in your Lane, ward an area, wait in a bush, etc. You will learn what to do with time.

Each champion has a Passive, 3 Abilities, and an Ultimate, as you can see on the image above. These are going to be the keys: QWER by default. Each one has its own cooldown and mana cost. 

On the right, are your item slots. When you buy items, they go here. You can buy components for an item, and combine them to a better item. You will learn this with time. Some items have an Active Ability, which means you press that corresponding number, and the item will use its effect. You can see the time remaining on the actual item. 



Minions Spawn: 
The Minions will spawn, and it's time to start. When a Minion dies near you, you get a small amount of XP (XP is what you use to level up). When you are Farming (aka killing minions to get gold and XP) you want to Last Hit them. Which is waiting until they have almost no health, and landing the killing blow on them. When you do, you also receive Gold. It will take time to learn how to farm and when to attack to Last Hit them. The bars above the minions are their health, and of course, the Red ones belong to the Red team and the Blue ones, the Blue team. You can only attack the enemies minions. 



If you are near them when they die, you get XP. This is how the Support levels up without killing all the minions. 




If you are near the enemy minions, and you have no minions nearby, they will attack you. If you are near them, and you attack an enemy, they will also attack you.

In LOL, you need to level up, gain gold, and buy items to become stronger. This is what's going to allow you to keep up with your enemies, and kill them and take objectives.

If you get too close to an enemy Tower, it will attack you. If your minions are there, it will attack them first. However if you attack an enemy while under their tower, it will target YOU instead. 



When you attack the Tower, you will see the health divided into chunks. Lowering their Health to one of those, will give you extra Gold! This only happens before the 14 minute mark, and this is called “Turret Plating.”

When in your lane, or outside of your base, you cannot buy items. In order to buy items you must be in your base, where you spawn. If you need to go back to your base, you can Recall by pressing B, and you will be sent back to the base so that you can automatically Heal, restore Mana/Energy, and buy items. 

Game Timing:
The game is split up into 3 “Sections” 

Early Game (Laning Phase), Mid Game, and Late Game. These are rough, and vary from game to game, but GENERALLY: 

Early Game: Is from the time the game starts, and you leave the fountain, until the first tower falls, and people start to roam around the map more. Generally, this is around 14-15 minutes. In the early game, your goal is to focus on your lane, farm, get kills, and to not die. This isn't teamfighting, this is you, in your lane, doing your job.

Mid Game: Starts after the Early Game (Laning Phase)  is over! Let's say you are in botlane, and you take the enemy tower. You now want to Rotate (which means to go to another lane) on over to Mid. Generally, mid game is going to be about 15-25 minutes. You will focus on team fights and objectives of course, but it's not your SOLE job, you still need to be farming and taking towers. 

Late Game: After the Mid Game, comes the Late Game. This is when you are all focused on Objectives. Generally, this is about 25/30 minutes to the end. You keep farming when you can and pushing lanes, but the focus is on teamfights, objectives, and pushing lanes. This is when Baron Nashor is going to spawn depending on the game, and you need to take Inhibitors, and fight as a team, more so than Mid Game. 
Pings: 

Control and dragging in a direction, brings up the Ping Wheel. Use this to communicate with your teammates. There are pings like:

“Group Up”
 “Caution” 
“All In” 
“Is Missing” 
“On My Way”
“Push” etc.



You can ping 3 times in a row, before it goes on Cooldown for a few seconds. Its great to get your team to let you know what you want to do. Ping “Attack!” on an enemy. Ping “I need help!” if you need your Jungler. Ping “On my way” to show where you are going. 

If you press Tab, you can bring up the Scoreboard, you can ping Items you have, by pressing Alt and clicking it. Same with the Shop. You can Alt press an item, to ping how much Gold you need to buy it. You can Alt click your level, or your XP bar, to let your team know how far you are from leveling up, or ping your Mana to let them know you don't have enough Mana to fight. Pings can be very useful. 

You can also mute other peoples pings if they are spamming them, or mute their Chat if they are being toxic. Press Tab, and next to their picture, is a little Sound Icon, and clicking around you can mute different things. Pings are great, just dont overdo them. 
Warding: 
Now a few more things, a major job of the Support, is warding. All lanes need to place wards as well though. You can place different kinds of Wards. The main being: 

Stealth Wards - Free - You can place up to 3, and it reveals enemies that walk in its radius, and they cannot see it. It does expire after some time. 

Control Wards - 75 Gold - You can place one at a time, they do not expire, and the enemy can see them. However, it will also reveal enemy Stealth Wards and hidden enemy traps. Also called Pink Wards

Farsight - Places a ward far away, however, its killed in one hit, and the enemy can see it. Cannot be purchased until you are level 9.

Oracle Lens - Scans the area, and reveals any enemy wards and traps (think mobile Control Ward)


You can also get Ward Skins to change the way they look. 


Top Lane: 
Good champs to start with: Garen, Darius, Mordekesier, Nasus, Sett.



Top laners are usually champions that are very durable, tanky, and very hard to kill. Top Laners are further away from the objectives and the action, hence them taking Teleport to be able to get places quickly. The Junglers may come to lane and attack, but generally it's a “1v1” lane. 

The only objective right near the toplane, as you can see on the map, is the Rift Herald / Baron Nashor / Void Grubs.

As a Top laner, you want to be getting towers (AKA Split Pushing, you taking towers while your team is elsewhere), helping with objectives, farming, and fighting the enemy. In teamfights you will be the tanky one generally, so you will be in the front and taking a good amount of damage. 

Jungle: 
Going to the Jungle side of things now, some more information: 

Good beginner champions: Hecarim, Warwick, Volibear, Nunu, Vi. 



The Junglers job is to kill the animal camps around the map to gain Gold and XP, as well as get Objectives like the Rift Herald, Dragons, Baron Nashor, etc. As well as Gank lanes to help them and possibly kill the enemy champs there. 

When starting, the Jungler will choose one of 3 eggs, which will spawn a creature that follows and attacks camps. Junglers must take the Smite Summoner Spell, as seen above. They use this to kill the camps and finish them off to clear the jungle faster. The pet will help you attack camps, and when you kill them, will also heal you. 

Junlgers will start with (generally) either the Red Buff or the Blue Buff. If they start on the Botlane side, generally the ADC and Sup will help them kill it by attacking it a few times, making sure to not land the final blow. As when killed, it gives the person who killed it a Buff (Mana regen / Health regen / Burn). Make sure to be on time to your lane of course, so a few attacks is generally plenty. This is called Leashing. 

Here is a Map of the different Camps:



Jungle Objectives:



When Jungling, you will have to learn the best order for you to go in, as well as when to go from the jungle, and into a lane to gank the enemies in that lane. Throughout the game, Jungle Objectives spawn. These being: 

Dragons, there are 7: Infernal, Mountain, Cloud, Ocean, Hextech, Chemtech, Elder. 

Killing one gives your team a buff, and it's different based on the type of Dragon. When a team kills 4 dragons, they receive an even bigger Buff called the Dragon Soul. After 4 have been killed, the next to spawn is the Elder Dragon, which is an even stronger dragon, with an even stronger buff. 

As you can see, when you kill a Dragon, the map changes a little bit. 



Void Grubs, are these cute guys below. They spawn at 5 minutes in the Rift Herald and Baron Nashor Alcove. There are 3 of them, and they will spawn twice throughout the game. Killing one, grants your entire team the buff “Touch of the Void,” If you have this buff, and attack a Tower, you will spawn little Void Mites that help attack and do more damage. There is a tad more to it, but that's the basics. 



Next is the Rift Herald, you can see the location on the map above. This is a Jungle Objective for the Jungler, but your teammates should also help you out with these. When killed, it drops an item you can pick up. When you use the item it spawns the Rift Herald, it charges, and does impact damage to the enemy turret (about half) and then continues attacking. 

You can also click on the Rift Herald, to hop inside and steer it. If you hit enemies, they will be Knocked Up, and It will spawn Void Mites that help attack the tower, and give you a shield. When trying to kill it, attacking the eye on its back does far more damage. 



1 Rift Herald can be killed before the 20:00 minute mark. At that time, Baron Nashor will spawn and if there is a Rift Herald in the alcove, it will despawn. When Baron spawns, the map will change slightly around it, and it gets different attacks based on one of the three forms that it takes. You will learn these with time. 

When killed, it gives you and your allies a buff, as well as any Minions that you get close to. This objective generally requires the whole team, and is very important. Teamfights will tend to happen around this objective. 

Baron Nashor's buff is called the Hand of Baron. It makes:

Your recall channel time is about half of what it normally is.
Your minions receive a speed boost, more damage, take less damage, and have more range.
You will also receive additional AD or AP

It lasts for 180 seconds. If you die, it goes away, and if you are dead when Baron is killed you will not receive the buff. 



The goal is to win, and play with your teammates. Destroy the enemy Towers, destroy their Inhibitors, and eventually their Nexus. There is of course so much more to it, but this is the bare bones basics. 
Mid Lane: 
Good beginner champions: Lux, Annie, Ahri, Malzahar, Veigar



If you are playing Mid, you are in the center of the map. You have access to all other areas, and can get to them faster than the other lanes. Because of this, you have to pay attention to your map, and the other lanes, to keep an eye on what is going on. The enemy Jungler will be passing through your lane a lot to get places, so always be careful. 

Mid laners are generally going to be more mobile, higher damage, champs. 

Part of being a Midlaner is learning when to roam and go to other lanes. You won't want to be AFK in your lane, again, always be paying attention. Being mid comes with responsibility. Keeping wards in the bushes next to your lane is always a good idea, so that you can see when the enemy is coming. 

If your Jungler needs help, you are generally going to be the person that can get there the fastest.


Bot Lane: ADC
Good beginner champs: Jinx, Ashe, Sivir, Miss Fortune, Caitlyn. 



Being in the Botlane, this is the ADC (Attack Damage Carry), also called a Marksman. 

As an ADC, you are wanting to farm, get gold, get items, and do lots of damage to the enemy. You will have a Support in lane with you. They help you do this by healing you, stunning enemies, and playing around and harassing the enemy so that you can do what you need to. It's a teamwork heavy lane.

In teamfights, you shouldn't be in the frontline, however you will be doing a LOT of damage to the enemies. When in your lane, the enemy Jungler will spend lots of time around there, as you are close to the objectives. When your Jungler is taking objectives, you will be there to help take those. 

You want to Farm, and get gold, and get items, to get stronger. You are the damage. 

You need to learn Wave Management, and how to control where your wave is. The Wave, being your minions that are coming to your lane. I won't go in depth. But you can learn how to freeze it, stall it, push it, etc.  
Bot Lane: Support
Good beginner champs: Lulu, Nami, Thresh (a tad harder), Janna, Lux.



When playing Support, your job is to, well, support your ADC. There are different types of Supports, just like other lanes, but generally there are Enchanters and Engage supports. 

Enchanter: Think shielding, buffing, throwing out spells, etc. 
Engage: Think hooks, getting up close, and letting your ADC follow up. 

The warding section of this guide is important for you. As a Support, you need to be clearing enemy wards, placing your own wards, and setting up the area before a Dragon spawns so that you can see the enemy and know when they are there. 

If you get a kill, great!  But that gold is much better used by your ADC, so your job is to support them, and make it easier for them to get gold, do damage, and kill.

You will Purchase the World Atlus, at the game start. This is your Support item. Hitting an enemy with ability grants you gold, or last hitting a minion. These have charges which you can see as the blue orbs floating around you. 
Classes: 

Each champion has a different Class that helps define them. Below are the classes present in LOL: 

Artillery - Mage 
Assassin - Slayer
Catcher - Controller
Diver - Fighter
Battle - Mage
Burst - Mage
Enchanter - Controller
Juggernaut - Fighter
Marksman
Skirmisher - Slayer
Specialist - Unclassified
Vanguard - Tank
Warden - Tank

Artillery: Artillery Mages are the masters of range, and they leverage that advantage to whittle down their opponents over time from great distances. In turn, Artillery Mages are severely punished when enemies finally succeed in closing in on them, due to their extreme fragility and limited mobility.

Assassins: Assassins specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put them themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Catcher: Catchers specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile and immobile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence

Diver: Divers are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

Battle: Battle Mages get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time.

Burst: Burst Mages aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.

Enchanter: Enchanters focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.

Skirmishers: Skirmishers (also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Wardens: Wardens are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm’s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray.

Juggernauts: Juggernauts are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp. They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage, but in turn they have a tough time closing in on targets due to their low range and extremely limited mobility.

Marksmen: Marksmen are ranged champions whose power almost exclusively revolves around their auto attacks, using their reach to land massive continuous damage from a distance, marksmen are capable of taking down even the toughest of opponents when positioned behind the safety of their team, and excel at securing map objectives.

Specialist: Specialists are a diverse group of champions who do not ""fit into a neat little box"" in regards to other class/subclass specifications.

Vanguards: Vanguards are offensive tanks. Vanguards lead the charge for their team and specialize at bringing the action. Their explosive team fight initiation seeks to catch enemies out of position while allowing allies to follow-up to devastating effect.

Loot, Champions, Skin, Etc

Below, will be information about Skins, Blue Essence, Orange Essence, Mythic Essence, Shards, etc. 

When you level up, you will receive a Champion Capsule. Inside will be Blue Essence, and Champion Shards. Blue Essence is used only for purchasing champions in the Store. Eventually, you will have more than you know what to do with. Twice a year there is an Essence Emporium you can buy Chromas. 

Champion Shards are used to unlock Champions from your Loot page. If you have a champion shard, you can use that with BE to unlock a champion for cheaper, or you can disenchant it into more Blue Essence. Below you can see the Champion Shards. 




You can also receive Hextech Chests, and Masterwork Chests, these require Keys to open. After a game people can honor you. If that happens enough, you receive Key Fragments (or you can purchase them in the store) Combine 3 of those and you get a Key. 

Inside of those you can receive different things, a main one being Skin Shards. Skin Shards will be in your Loot, and they require Orange Essence to unlock. Once you unlock it, it is yours forever. The skin is of course, a Skin for that champion. You can also Reroll 3 of them, to get a mystery Skin that is unlocked right away and is yours forever. Or you can disenchant them for OE.

Eternals are optional, and are just stat trackers for certain champs. You can turn those into OE. 



Mythic Essence is used to purchase things from the Mythic Shop, which should show when you click on the ME in your Loot. It rotates every few patches with Skins that used to be available, but aren't anymore, and some new ones. These are generally going to be the Mythic level skins and Prestige Skins.



Chromas are different color variants of any skins you have. So if you have a skin you love, but don't like the color, you can equip a Chroma to change that. 



Of course, you can always just buy RP from the Store and directly buy anything you want as well. 

You can unlock Emotes that you can use during the game, and these are on a wheel accessed by holding T in game. 





Battle Pass: 
If you want the BattlePass, you can purchase a ticket in the store, and then you play games to level it up. At the end you can trade in tokens for the Prestige Skin, they cost 2000 tokens. You can also buy ME (Mythic Essence) that is bought with 2200 tokens. They last about a month, give or take, and we get multiple per year. 
You can buy different Chromas and Borders with Tokens. But the 2 above are the main things. 
Borders, you can buy for a Skin, so that when you use that skin, there's a Border on your Player Icon when loading into the game using that Skin.

You can level the pass from level 1 - level 50 by playing games and earning XP, after level 50 you can continue to level it up and you will earn 20 Tokens per level. There is no cap, so you can earn as many Tokens as you want. 
If you play enough, you can get Tokens for both the Prestige and the Mythic Essence. 
400XP levels you up to the next level in the BattlePass. 
You can buy Orbs as well during the event with Tokens. They cost 200 tokens and have a random Skin Shard. 
Each event has a different theme, some past ones are: Spirit Blossom, High Noon, Star Guardian, Worlds, Winterblessed, PsyOps, Dark Star, etc.

 
Season End Rewards: 
At the end of the Ranked, or a Split, season there are 2 rewards that are sent out: 

Victorious Skin: If you have played enough Ranked games, Or made it to Gold or above at the season end / split, you will receive the skin. There are 3 Victorious Skins per year. 

Honor Skin: If you end the season at Honor Level 5, you will receive that years Honor Skin.

Mobalytics,What is League of Legends?,"League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena, also known as a MOBA. It’s been one of the most popular games of all time and currently one of the biggest esports.

In a standard game of League, ten players are split into two teams of five and battle it out on a map called Summoner’s Rift.

Each of these players controls a single character, known as a champion.
"
Mobalytics,What is a Champion?,"All ten players in a League of Legends match controls a single champion.

There are currently over 140 champions with new ones being continuously added over time.

Every champion has special abilities and powers with unique playstyles.

Before a game begins at champ select, each team takes turns selecting champions.

There’s a lot of strategies involved as you work with your team to create teams with champions that work well together (more on this later).

Every game you play can be vastly different since every champion has their own feel and gameplan."
Mobalytics,How do you win?,"The ultimate goal of LoL is to destroy the other team’s base, but it’s not easy.

Your enemies will do everything they can to kill you and destroy your base.

Each base has a series of turrets and waves of minions that constantly spawn.

If you started a game and tried to run straight to the enemy base, you’d certainly die, not just because the enemy team would be trying to stop you at all costs, but also because you may be too weak and die.

League is sort of like a role-playing game (RPG) that takes place in a very short amount of time.

You begin at level 1 and gradually get stronger throughout the game by gaining experience and earning gold to buy items.

The two teams continually grow in power and collide. Eventually, one team is able to get the upper hand and make a final push for a victory."
Mobalytics,What is Summoner's Rift?,"This is the standard map that the professionals play on and it’s where you’d be if you were trying to climb the ranked ladder.

There are other maps in League, but for now, we’ll focus on Summoner’s Rift since it’s where you’ll likely be spending most of your time.

Summoner's Rift map

Here are the basics of the Summoner’s Rift map:

There are two teams of five players: the blue team (base at bottom left corner) and the red team (base at the top right corner).

To achieve victory, one team has to destroy the opposing team’s Nexus (basically the core of their base).

During a match, minions will continually spawn from each base’s Nexus and proceed through the three lanes (the paths are shown in the graphic above).

The three lanes are known as top lane, mid lane, and bot lane. In all three lanes, there are turrets which will attack enemy champions and minions.Nexus and turretsSummoners must destroy all turrets in at least one lane and then destroy the last two towers that protect a Nexus before being able to attack and destroy it.

Turrets and Inhibitors
Destroying turrets and other structures called inhibitors rewards players with gold and allows the minion waves to push through the lane (since there aren’t any turrets to stop them).

Inhibitors are structures that are behind the initial turrets inside a base. If an inhibitor is destroyed, upgraded minions, called Super Minions, will spawn until an inhibitor respawns after a few minutes.Super minionsA team can often use the Super Minions to successfully siege a base that was previously difficult to attack and create an opportunity to push to victory.

The Fountain and Shop
At the beginning of each game, you’ll begin at your fountain. You’ll revisit your fountain because it’s where you’ll respawn when you die and it’s where your shop is located.Fountain and shopYou can return to your fountain at any time during a game to heal or purchase items. All you have to do is use the Recall ability which every summoner has access to – just be careful and use it safely because you can be interrupted while casting it.

Income and Items
As we mentioned earlier, killing a minion, structure, or enemy champion grants players gold which can be used to purchase items at the fountain’s shop.

The ultimate purpose of gold is to give players to have flexibility in their stat growth and play styles. Whether you want more damage, survivability, or utility, there are a wide variety of items to fit your needs.

We recommend checking out our LoL item guides series if you want to learn more about what different items do and when to build them."
Mobalytics,LoL Champion Basics,"Now that we understand the basics of the map, let’s get back to talking about champions. Champions are the heart and soul of League of Legends as they’re often what players resonate with most.

While Summoner’s Rift stays constant, the different combinations of champions that are chosen by the ten players in game can create vastly different rhythms and feels.

Right now there are currently over 140 champions, each of them representing a different playstyle and experience.All LoL championsSome are simple and easy to play while others may take a hundred games to master. Whether you like dealing damage from afar, brawling at close quarters, or helping your team with utility, there’s a champion for you."
Mobalytics,Guide 2-3,"Auto-attacks and Abilities
Every champion has auto-attacks and abilities at their disposal. Auto-attacks, also known as “basic attacks” occur when a player right clicks on a target. Doing so will cause a champion to continually attack a target until it dies.

Abilities are cast using Q, W, E, and R. Every champion has abilities that are unique to them for each of these buttons. Here’s Ashe’s W, Volley, in action below:

Ashe's W, Volley

All champions also have access to two abilities, using D and F, called Summoner Spells. These are up to a player’s personal preference, we’ll discuss these later on.

Lastly, champions can also cast abilities from items such as Redemption and Tiamat, using the number keys, 1-7.

Champion Stats
A major aspect that sets champions apart is the distribution of their stats. Stats represent a champion’s make up as far as how hard they are to kill, how much damage they do, and how fast they move or attack.

LoL champion stats
From left to right: attack damage, ability power, armor, magic resist, attack speed, ability haste, critical strike chance, movement speed.

For the purpose’s of this beginner guide, we won’t be getting too technical about stats. Here are the basics:

Health (indicated by a green bar)
Health represents the amount of damage you can take before dying and being sent to your fountain.
Ability Resources: Mana, Energy, and others
Abilities cost resources in order to cast them, most champions use mana, energy, or fury.
The majority of champions, such as Lux and Vel’Koz, use mana.
Mana is indicated by a blue bar below the health bar and regenerates over time.
Champions such as Akali and Kennen use energy.
Energy is indicated by a yellow bar and also regenerates over time but at a much faster rate. These champions often have ways to get energy back as well, such as by auto-attacking.
The tradeoff is that unlike mana, you cannot increase the amount of energy you have through buying items.
Other champions use other sources, such as their health, fury, rage, or courage.
Using health is straightforward, your champion basically takes damage in order to cast their spell.
Fury, rage, and courage, are dependent on their champions. Be sure to check them out for more details.
Attack Damage (AD)
Attack damage, also known as physical damage, represents the damage dealt by basic auto-attacks.
Depending on a champion, AD can also empower abilities.
Numbers from abilities and items that refer to attack damage are displayed as orange.
Ability Power (AP)
Ability power primarily makes your abilities (QWER) more powerful, however, AP can also strengthen some items and runes.
Numbers from abilities and items that refer to ability power are displayed as green.
Armor
Armor is a defensive stat that mitigates physical damage. Building it will help you survive against champions with a lot of attack damage.
Magic Resist (MR)
You probably guessed it, but magic resist is the counterpart to armor that mitigates damage from ability power.
Attack Speed (AS)
Attack speed represents how fast your champion auto-attacks. In general, this is a good combination with attack damage if you’re looking to increase your physical damage output.
Ability Haste
Abilities have “cooldowns” representing how long it will be before you can cast it again. Items that give you ability haste allow you to cast abilities more often.
Critical Strike Chance
This stat represents your chance of landing a critical strike – critical strikes cause your auto-attacks to deal double its damage.
For example, if you have 50% crit chance, your attacks will likely crit 50% of the time. If you have 100% crit chance, they will crit every time.
Movement Speed (MS)
Movement speed represents how fast your champion moves around the map. This can be increased with abilities and items such as boots.
Experience and Leveling up a Champion
In League of Legends, every champion starts at level 1 and continues to level up until the max of level 18.

Champions gain experience by farming minions and jungle camps or killing (or assisting in killing) champions.

Note that killing jungle camps or monsters will only provide experience for the player who landed the killing blow.

Destroying turrets and inhibitors grants experience to a whole team globally.

Experience range
Even at this range, Aurelion Sol will get experience when the minion dies.

You can also gain experience by being within range of enemy minions or enemy champions dying. This radius is about equal to around 3x a champion’s auto-attack (exactly 1600 range).

Gaining levels and experiences allows champions to grow in power. While buying items allow champions to have freedom in choosing which stats to gain, gaining levels activates predetermined increases to a champion’s stats.

For example, at level 1, Ashe will have around 539 base hp. At level 18, she’ll have 1984. This growth applies to health, health regen, mana, mana regen, attack damage, attack speed, armor, and magic resist.

Leveling up also grants skill points which are used to increase the power of a champion’s QWER abilities.

Ashe Skill Level Up

The effect of skill points can be dependent on the champion and the ability itself. In the example above for Ashe’s W, Volley, increasing from ability level 1 to 2 will yield an increase of damage from 20 to 35 and a reduction in CDR from 15 to 12.5 seconds.

Summoner Spells
Beyond their QWER abilities, every summoner also must choose two summoner spells for their champion. Summoner spells act as two additional abilities with their own purposes and cooldowns.

all summoner spells

They offer flexibility in helping you adapt at champ select and allow you to play toward your preferred playstyle. When you first start playing, you’ll gradually unlock them over time (check out the section at the bottom for more info). In this section, we’ll be going over what each one does and why you’d want to take it.

Heal (240 second cooldown)
Heal

Heal instantly replenishes some of your health (based on your level) and increases your movement speed by 1%.
It also heals one other ally. You can choose which one it targets by hovering them when you cast Heal. If you don’t specifically with your cursor it will automatically heal the ally closet to dying.
This is most commonly seen at a bot lane by the ADC role or sometimes, the Support role. This is because it heals two allies at once, giving it more value there than compared to other roles.
Ghost (180 second cooldown)
Ghost

This summoner spell grants a large amount of increased movement speed (based on level) for 10 seconds and allows you to run through units (champions, monsters, minions).
Ghost makes a great choice for champions that rely on chasing down their opponents or want to stay at a safe distance.
It’s a lot less flexible than its counterpart, Flash, so you’ll often see it paired with Flash rather than replacing it.
Barrier (180 second cooldown)
Barrier

Barrier instantly grants you a shield (based on your level) that is great for mitigating burst damage.
You’ll often see Barrier for the Mid lane role but it’s also taken by ADCs and Supports.
Exhaust (210 second cooldown)
Exhaust

Exhaust slows a champion and reduces their damage output by 40% over 2.5 seconds.
This is primarily used defensively but can be used as a crowd control option for chasing opponents.
Flash (300 second cooldown)
Flash

Flash is by far the most popular summoner spell. It allows you to blink a short distance in any direction.
This may sound very simple at first but the flexibility Flash offers let’s it be equally viable in offensive and defensive situations.
You can use it to engage and surprise an enemy, or use it to escape over a wall or out of harm’s way.
Teleport (360 second cooldown)
Teleport

This summoner spell allows you to instantly teleport to an allied ward, minion, or tower.
Be aware that this takes 4-seconds to channel and it can be interrupted by a stun or other forms of crowd control.
Smite (210 second cooldown)
Smite

Smite allows you to instantly cast a high burst damage spell upon a minion, monster, or pet (a minion controlled by a champion’s abilities).
This is a jungler’s core summoner spell and is required in order to play the role.
Smiting objectives (see the objectives section) allows you to secure them more reliably to get the last-hit before your foes.
It also helps clear jungle camps and offers increased damage or a slow based on the jungle item upgrade you purchase.
Cleanse (210 second cooldown)
Cleanse

This summoner spell is sort of like a get out of jail free card as it removes all disables (except for being airborne from knockouts or being suppressed).
It allows you to get out of an otherwise tight situation and also increases your tenacity, which means that it makes you temporarily resistant to additional incoming crowd control effects.
Ignite (180 second cooldown)
Ignite

Ignite is a spell that lasts over 5 seconds and inflicts burning damage.
It can often help you secure a kill as an enemy is trying to escape if you’re able to land it in time.
It also decreases the amount of healing a champion can receive so it’s useful against champions with healing effects.
This also implies that it counters the Heal spell, just make sure to cast Ignite before the Heal goes off.
Runes
League of Legends is all about discovering the best way for you to play based on your personal preferences. On top of summoner spells, runes provide another way for you to tune your champion to either maximize their strengths or to help keep their weaknesses in check.

Runes

In this section, we’ll be covering the overarching themes of each of the five main rune trees and explaining how to equip rune pages.

The five rune trees are Precision, Domination, Sorcery, Resolve, and Inspiration.

Precision
Precision

Focuses on empowering auto-attacks making it ideal for ranged carries like Ashe or a melee fighter like Tryndamere.
Example: Press the Attack rewards you for continuously attacking the same target by increasing your overall damage output.
Domination
Domination

Improves your ability to instantly burst or kill a target, it’s no surprise that you’ll often see assassins like Katarina or Talon take Domination.
Example: Predator grants you a huge burst of movement speed to allow you to quickly chase down your prey.
Sorcery
Sorcery

Sorcery augments your abilities but also provides a good amount of utility. It’s most commonly taken by mages and casters like Karma or Lux.
Example: Summon Aery improves the punch of your spells and also increases the potency of supportive spells by shielding an ally you cast on.
Resolve
Resolve

If you’re looking to bolster your defensive capabilities, this is your rune. Beefy tanks and engagers like Nautilus and Leona love the Resolve tree.
Example: Aftershock provides a burst of bonus armor and magic resist if you immobilize an enemy.
Inspiration
Inspiration

Inspiration is all about breaking the rules with wacky powers and capabilities. It can be used by many different champions but is very situational.
Example: Unsealed Spellbook allows you to switch your summoner spells to other ones, rewarding your ability to adapt and think ahead.
Rune Page

At summoner level 10, you’ll receive full access to customize your rune page. You can create a rune page in your client outside of game or during champ select. Either way, your created rune page will stay saved until you delete it for another one or change it.

When creating a rune page there are three main components:

Primary tree
Secondary tree
Shards
Note that choosing runes can be tricky because you can only choose one rune per row, so make sure to keep that in mind.

The primary tree grants you access to a rune tree’s most powerful choices, known as a keystone. In total, you’ll get four rune choices from your primary tree so make sure they’re in line with what your champion excels at.

The secondary tree only provides you with two choices, you’ll want to use this to compliment your primary tree.

Lastly, you get three choices of shards. Shards provide a little bit of flexibility independent of the five trees. For example, you can choose between having additional raw damage, more attack speed, or shorter cooldowns.

Shards aren’t as powerful as your primary and secondary tree but can allow you to have more flexibility to cater to your playstyle or help prepare you against a bad matchup.

Ashe Rune Build
A suggested rune build from Ashe’s champion page.

Understanding optimal rune builds can be difficult, especially as a beginner. Be sure to try them all out and check out our champion pages where we curate and constantly update the best rune pages for every role.

3. The Five LoL Roles
In a standard game of League of Legends, each of the five players on a team is assigned to one of the five specific roles. The five roles are Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, and Support.

Before a match, you have the opportunity to select a primary role which indicates the role you’d prefer to play, as well as a secondary role which represents a backup choice.

Since roles vary in popularity, keep in mind that you are not guaranteed to get either of your primary or secondary choices. You can also choose an option to “Fill” which means that you don’t mind playing any of the roles.

Positional Roles
From left to right: Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support, and at the bottom, Fill.

If you’re a brand new player, we suggest that you spend time playing a few games of each role to get a feel for where each one operates and what each one does. Eventually, you do want to settle on a “main” role because it can really help you improve faster and learn to specialize a particular skill set.

For more reasons on why you should pick a main role and some guidelines for understanding the expectations of the five roles, check out our infographic below:

How to Choose Your Main Role in League of Legends (infographic)

Keep in mind that these were just guidelines regarding the five roles. The champions that are played within each role and the expectations for each often change over time as players experiment and optimize.

For example, in Season 8, many champions that would be normally found in mid lane became temporarily commonplace at the ADC role (this is a story for another time).

League of Legends role mapUse these guidelines to get a solid foundation for what each role in the game’s current state (circa Season 9) to get you off your feet, but as you get better, don’t be afraid to try things out in a Normal match. If you find a new way to play a role that works well, put it to the test in a ranked match!"
Mobalytics,Guide 4-6,"4. What is a team comp?
Since League of Legends is a 5 vs 5 team game, the combinations of champions that your team assembles at champ select can be incredibly important. Often times, you can greatly increase your chances of winning by synergizing the abilities and strengths of your choices.

Champ select

An easy example to understand is an area-of-effect team (AoE) composition. This team combines five champions who have spells and abilities that can either deal damage to multiple champions or hold multiple champions in place with crowd control.

Every team comp tends to have a goal in mind, known as a win condition. The win condition of an AoE comp is to catch and kill multiple team members at once. If the AoE comp is able to do so, they will likely win a fight.

Another example of a team comp would be the skirmish comp. Skirmish team comps utilize champions that have high mobility and like to fight in messy fights from multiple angles.

A skirmish team comp would likely beat an AoE team comp because an AoE team comp would struggle to lock down multiple skirmishers at once if they play their cards right.

Since the AoE team comp relies on powerful spells that have long cooldowns, while skirmishers have attacks and abilities that are weaker but can be cast more often, the skirmish team comp can play around the abilities of the AoE team comp.

In the infographic below, we cover the strengths and weaknesses of the most common team compositions:

League of Legends Team Comps

If you’re learning about the game as a new player, don’t worry too much about creating the perfect team comp at champ select. You’ll want to focus more on just playing your comfort champions and mastering them.

We just wanted to introduce you since it is something that will be mentioned often in game and in other places such as if you watch pro-play or streamers.

5. Fog of War and Vision Control
Fog of War

In League of Legends, you must make decisions with incomplete information. This is because you cannot see everything that is happening on the map due to something called the “fog of war”

The fog of war is shown on the minimap as a darkened area, as shown to the left. It conceals enemy movement and you want to be careful not to wander through it unless you have company or if you have a good understanding of where your opponents are.

Likewise, your team can use the fog of war to hide your movements and strike your enemies from the shadows.

You and all of your allied champions and structures provide vision for your whole team. If you can see it, so can your teammates.

Outside of these sources of vision, you also have the ability to create more vision using items called “wards”.

At the beginning of the match, every player in the game has access to a free item, called the Warding Totem, which is also known as the “yellow ward”.

Use the yellow ward to protect yourself by alerting your team of enemy movement. In the image below, the ward placed in the bush spots an enemy Vi that is moving around top lane.

If the ward was not there, you or your teammates who were near the top side of the map may have been blindsided and killed.

The vision control here allows your team the opportunity to retreat or set up a counter trap to kill the Vi.

Yellow Trinket

These wards will last a limited amount of time and will eventually expire, so be sure to keep an eye on its time remaining.

You’ll know how much time is left on a ward by clicking on it or seeing the white bar (seen in the image above), which ticks down as time passed. If the time runs out, it’ll disappear.

Take note that the ward also has a green health bar comprised of three blocks. This is a good time to let you know that wards can be destroyed by the enemy team. Each block on the green bar represents an auto-attack hit, so it would take three hits to kill the Warding Totem.

There are different types of wards in League of Legends (we’ll cover them in this article). This type of ward stays invisible unless it is revealed by the enemy team by a Control Ward or Red Trinket.

Control Ward

Control wards take four hits to be destroyed but are visible to everyone. Within a certain radius, control wards block the vision of enemy wards and reveal where they are.

You can strategically use control wards to deny enemy vision from an important area on the map or to clear a ward that you know had been placed.

The other major method of clearing wards is the Oracle Lens, also known as the red trinket. The red trinket allows a player to walk around and expose enemy wards around them (shown in the image below).

Red trinket
Clearing enemy wards throughout a match is incredibly important as it denies their ability to track your teams movements and also allows you to find gaps in their defenses to attack.

It’s important that everyone contributes to this cause and it’s normal for every team to eventually have 1-2 red trinkets dedicated to seeking and destroying enemy wards.

The last type of ward is the Farsight Alteration, also known as the blue trinket. Blue trinket allows a player to place a ward at a much further distance, and it will remain there until it is destroyed.

Blue trinket

The downside is that it is visible to the enemy team and dies in one hit – because of this, this is the most situational ward and is mostly only used by the most vulnerable member of your team or a champion that relies on very long range attacks.

It’s a common mistake for newer players to forget about fighting for vision control (even experienced players forget to prioritize it). Remember that the more information you have, the better decisions you’ll make. Make a conscious effort to do your part in placing wards and denying your enemies of vision and eventually it’ll be second nature.

6. The River, Jungle, and Camps
In between the lanes, you may notice the river that runs across the map as well as large sections of forest areas.

These areas are crucial because a lot of action occurs here as players move about to fight and contest monster camps and objectives.

Unlike minions which belong to a particular team, these monster camps are neutral and can be slain by any player.Jungle camps

Some camps are weak enough for one champion to clear on their own. This gives your team an additional source of income outside of the constant stream of minions.

Since these camps respawn over time, there’s a role in League of Legends completely dedicated to collecting these camps and moving throughout the jungle (check out jungler in the role section).

Several of these camps also provide additional utility and temporary upgrades called “buffs” It’s important for your team to secure these buffs to give you the edge over your opponents.

Blue buff image

For example, killing the Blue Sentinel grants the Crest of Insight (also known as “blue buff”) which grants increased mana regeneration and ability haste (more on these champion stats later).

Slaying the Red Brambleback gives Crest of Cinders (also known as “red buff”) which grants increased health regen and causes your auto-attacks to slow your enemy and deal additional damage.

Jungle Plants
As you travel around the map through the river and jungle, you’ll notice interactive plants popping up. They don’t provide gold, experience, or buffs, but if you use them correctly, they can often save your life or help you facilitate a good fight.

The Blast Cone
The red plant you see in the jungle is the blast cone. Blast cones cause any champion within its radius to fly and land at a set distance.

In the picture below, you can see Rammus next to a cone and a red circle outline on the other side of the wall to his right.

Blast ConeIf Rammus or any other champion would auto-attack the blast cone, Rammus would trampoline and land on the red circled outline. Spells and abilities will not affect the blast cone.

The blast cone allows champions that could not otherwise jump over or through walls to do so, allowing for more efficient movement and creative angles for ambushing opponents.

A well-timed blast cone jump can often give you enough distance to escape from a pack of enemies chasing you.

However, do be careful of your auto-attack timing as you may accidentally blast yourself towards your pursuers or launch an ally into danger.

Scryer’s Bloom
Scryer’s Bloom grants you a short glimpse into darkness as it reveals enemy champions or enemy wards (items that grant vision).

In the image below, if Rammus auto-attacks Scryer’s Bloom, it will create a cone of cleared vision in the direction that Rammus is facing.

Scryer's BloomAlthough it may not seem like much at first, don’t underestimate this plant’s ability to help you track down an enemy that would have otherwise escaped or allow you to reveal an assassin stalking you from the shadows.

Honeyfruit
The last type of plant you’ll see around the map is the Honeyfruit. These spawn along the river and grant health and mana if you pop the plant with an auto-attack and walk over its fruits.

In the picture below, Sona has auto-attacked the Honeyfruit and is replenishing her resources.

This grants an opportunity for her to return back to battle when she may have otherwise needed to return back to base.

Honey FruitNow, it probably seems like a no-brainer to try to get Honeyfruits whenever they’re available but you’ll actually have to be careful when you do so.

As you walk over the fruits, each one will actually slow down your movespeed. If you’re being chased, you may want to consider skipping the fruit to maximize your chances of survival.

This also means that if a foe you’re hunting down runs close enough by the plant, you may be able to slow them down by hitting the Honeyfruit.

The Scuttle Crab
Along the rivers, you’ll see a neutral monster, called the Scuttle Crab that walks back and forth near the Dragon pit and Baron pit. Slaying the crab will grant vision in the river near the openings of each respective pit.Scuttle Crab

The Scuttle Crab is incredibly easy to kill because it doesn’t fight back but it can be hard to consistently take because it will be highly prioritized due to the free vision it provides. If you’re a jungler, be sure to prioritize this camp as a stop as you travel the map, and if you’re another role, be ready to help your jungler if the enemy team is looking to stop them.

Elemental Dragons
All League of Legends dragons spawn at the bot side dragon pit. The 6 elemental dragons, also known as elemental drakes, grant team-wide buffs to ALL players on the side that kills them.



Here are their names and their effect:

Cloud Drake = increased movement speed when you aren’t fighting
Infernal Drake= grants ability power and attack damage
Mountain Drake = increases damage against objectives (turrets, Dragon, Baron)
Ocean Drake= grants missing health and mana regen when you aren’t fighting
Hextech Drake= empowers auto-attacks
Chemtech Drake= extra attack speed
Dragon

The drakes spawn at random and you can get the same element multiple times. Each effect stacks up to three times and becomes more powerful. For example, slaying one Cloud Drake will grant your team +15 bonus movement speed out of combat – if you’re able to get three, you’ll have a total of +45 bonus movement speed.

Getting an elemental dragon won’t help you win instantly but can make the game easier for you and your teammates overtime. They’re quite powerful in the early to mid game so they will often require multiple team members to slay, especially if the other team is looking to contest it.

The Elder Dragon
The Elder Dragon, also known as Elder Drake, spawns in the late game and is the most powerful dragon in the game. Slaying an Elder Drake grants a buff that multiplies the effects of all the elemental dragon buffs that your team currently has by 50%.

If you’re able to kill two Elder Dragons, all of your elemental buffs will be multiplied by 100%. It also grants additional damage to non-turret targets (such as champions and monsters).

Aspect of the Dragon

This makes Elder Dragon one of the best late game monsters to help your team secure a victory in a close match, especially if you were successful in taking elemental dragons earlier in the game.

Rift Herald
The Rift Herald is a monster that resides in the Baron pit before Baron is slain or spawns near 20 minutes.

The Herald is quite tanky so you may need multiple members of your team to kill it. A crucial tip to remember is that it has a weak spot on it’s back that will inflict additional damage if you hit it.

Rift HeraldAfter a team kills the Herald, a purple item, called Eye of the Herald, will drop that one allied team member can pick up (it cannot be touched by the team that did not kill it). When picked up, the item will replace the player’s trinket slot and will remain there until it is used.

The effect of the Eye of the Herald is one of the most devastating in the game, so it’s not surprising that it only has one use. Activating the Eye will summon the Herald to fight for your team by attacking enemy structures until it dies. Here it is below:



As you can see, the Rift Herald inflicts a massive amount of damage. It can often help you take the first turret in the game which can help swing an even game into your favor.

One last tip is that activating the Eye requires a short amount of channeling time – if the player using it is interrupted by a hard crowd control effect such as a stun, silence, or knockup., they will fail to summon the Rift.

So if you’re using it, be sure to do so safely away from combat. If you know the other team is looking to use it, try to keep vision on them and look to CC them while they’re channeling.

Baron Nashor
The last monster you’ll need to know about is the Baron Nashor, also known as just “Baron”. Baron is the most powerful monster in Summoner’s Rift so you’ll need multiple team members to slay it unless a match goes on for a very long time (eventually few or even one champion may be able to slay it on their own).

Baron Nashor

Since Baron is so strong, teams can often win by killing a team that’s low on health because they tried to take it at a bad time. It can often be the site of a “final battle” at the end of a close game as the winning team can use it to get a big enough lead to secure a victory.

So what does slaying Baron do exactly? It grants a buff, called Hand of Baron, that is given to all living members of the team that slayed the Baron. This means that if you died while fighting Baron or for Baron, you will not receive the buff if you are still dead when the final blow is made.

Hand of Baron

Hand of Baron temporarily grants AD and AP and strengthens minions that you are close to. This makes it much easier to push toward the enemy Nexus since it’s harder for the enemy team to kill the empowered minions and easier for your team to defend them.

If you do not outright win by pushing with Baron minions, the enemy base will likely be destroyed enough to make your future attempts much easier. So don’t be too greedy and overextend. If you can only get a few turrets and inhibitors, that’s still a good gain."
Mobalytics,Guide 7-end,"7. The Three Phases and Scaling
These concepts are leaning more towards being intermediate than beginner, but we want to quickly go over them since you’ll likely hear the terminology of the three phases: early game, mid game, and late game.

The phases aren’t set in stone and act more as guidelines as every game is different in its own way, but they tend to hold true to regarding how the majority of games turn out:

Early game (the first 15 minutes)

This is when all the turrets are up and everyone is in their lane except for the junglers.
Until the jungler arrives, top and mid will mostly be 1v1 and bot lane will mostly be 2v2.
Mid game (15 to 30 minutes)

At around 15 minutes, or when the first turrets begin to be destroyed, the mid game begins.
During the mid game, a match becomes messier than lane phase as some players will remain in lane while others will begin to roam around the map to help destroy other turrets or contest dragons or Rift Herald.
Late game (after 30 minutes)

The mid game usually ends and around the 30 minute mark when all of the first turrets in the lanes are destroyed (sometimes even more are gone by then). This is the late game.
At this point, champions have acquired many of their major items and teams begin to group for large teamfights around Baron and Elder Dragons.
So why are the three phases important? In League of Legends, every champion is designed to be good during a certain time period. Some champions are designed to be strong in the early game but fall off the longer the game goes while others are designed to be weak early but get continuously stronger as the game goes on.

When a champion is at their strongest, it is known as a “power spike”. The process of getting gradually stronger and achieving your power spike is known as “scaling”. We won’t get too into detail here but know that scaling is usually influenced by a champion’s ability kit and their stat ratios as they buy more items. Let’s cover a few examples.

Blitzcrank: Early game power spike
Blitzcrank power spike
Blitzcrank is one of the scariest early game supports because of his signature move, Rocket Grab, which pulls an enemy toward him. One well-timed grab can pull a vulnerable target and turn a 2v2 into a very quick 1v2 death.

His whole kit revolves around making picks and gaining an early advantage for his team. As the game goes on, however, Blitzcrank’s grab loses power because it becomes harder for him to grab his ideal target.

Instead of worrying about weaving his grab through a minion wave, he has to worry about getting it through a frontline of tanks during teamfights. His ability is also outclassed by better engage options that can target multiple champions instead of just one.

Ahri: Mid game power spike
Ahri power spike
The mid game is all about quick rotations with messy skirmishers and unpredictable team fights. Ahri hits her power spike during this time because she is a mage that utilizes a high amount of mobility and lower cooldown abilities that can be cast often.

Mid game fights are often fought from different angles and uneven numbers (3v2’s, 2v4’s, etc) so being mobile and flexible has more value. She can use hit and run tactics and move around the map quickly to help her laners that are still trying to take their turret or her jungler who is contesting objectives.

She isn’t necessarily bad in the early game but will be outdamaged by champions that have less mobility and more punch, and she tends to fall off in the late game since she doesn’t have strong late game scaling compared to other champions.

Kog’Maw: Late game power spike
Kog'Maw power spike

When the late game arrives, you’ll start to see large scale teamfights with high stakes. One false move can mean all five of your allies dying and a charge by the enemy team to destroy your base.

Kog’Maw is a champion who’s easy to kill when alone but able to deal an insane amount of damage when he’s protected (some team comps are even built around him). In the organized situations during the late game where you have multiple frontliners and a backline of damage dealers, Kog’Maw is at his best.

He hits his spike during the late game because he also has access to most or all of his items. During the early game he’s focused on farming and won’t do that much damage and in the mid game, he’s vulnerable during skirmishes since they often happen from multiple angles.

How to learn power spikes
You can learn power spikes over time by just playing but you can study them at any time by checking out our champion pages:

Ashe champion page

The bottom line is to look to fight when your champion is at their most powerful state and to be wary of enemies when they are about to hit their power
spike. Also, be aware of factors like farm and experience level – if it’s the late game but a Kog’Maw hasn’t farmed very well, they’re likely to be more at a yellow state than a green state.

8. How to get better at League of Legends

The Gamer Performance Index (GPI)
In order to develop at a consistent rate, it’s crucial to understand your identity as a player. This includes being able to evaluate your strengths, weaknesses, and overall playstyle. After all, if you don’t have a clear picture of what you’re good at or bad at, you may be working on things that you don’t need to and ignoring gaps in your gameplay that you may not have perceived.

Mobalytics Desktop App Challenges fullThe GPI is designed for this specific function, illustrating your unique fingerprint as a player as a graph. We run all of your games and the stats from those games through our GPI system to define this graph.

Above, you can that the GPI is comprised of 8 main skills:

Aggression
Consistency
Farming
Fighting
Objectives
Survivability
Versatility
Vision
These 8 skills comprehensively cover all the essential performance areas that are critical to succeed in League of Legends. Based on your scores, the GPI will provide you with specific advice to help you improve your areas of weakness. Here’s an example:

Dueling advice

You’ll see all types of advice: tips and tricks, infographics, videos, article links, the list goes on! Once you’ve mastered an area, you’ll be guided to another skill to focus. So what are you waiting for? let’s check out that GPI!

Live Companion
We created the GPI to help you understand who you are as a player and help you improve your individual skills. The GPI however, requires multiple games (usually around 5-10) to see trends in your performance. If you’re looking to prepare for your very next game, you’ll want to use our Live Companion tool.

On the left side, it has info on all the players in your match, such as their ranks, win rates, and information about their playstyle. On the right, you’ll get everything you need to know to about how to play your champion, such as runes, skill order, and items. You’ll also be able to see advice for playing against your lane matchup and advice for playing against all enemy champions.

Moblaytics Pre Game

It can seem like a lot of information but the truth is, we wanted to equip players with all the information they could ask for. In most cases, you’ll only need to brush up on a few things, such as advice for your lane matchup and scouting power spikes. Since every player is different and prepares in different ways, we decided to give you pretty much everything you need and then some.

Challenges
Another awesome feature for beginners is Challenges! This tool is designed to improve your skills by giving you in-game goals.

The in-game goals are based on your role, rank, and GPI scores. For example, if you’re need help with Farming, you’ll automatically be given Challenges to help you improve those scores.
