Summoner's Rift that's replacing Blind Pick. It allows you to pre-pick up to two champions/positions, so you can queue with 100% confidence that you'll play who you want, where you want.\r\n\r\nWHY IS QUICKPLAY REPLACING BLIND PICK?\r\nThe short version: We wanted to create a mode that was better-suited for new players and made it easier for you to pick a certain champion in a certain lane without all the extra hurdles of Champ Select.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING FOR QUICKPLAY\r\ntwo-champs-full-screen.png\r\nUnlike other game modes, your champion/position selection happens before you enter the queue. This way you're guaranteed to always get one of the two champs you pick, and you'll never be forced outside of your top two positions. Once you've picked your champions, don't forget to customize their Runes, Spells, and skin. \r\n\r\nIn order to get Quickplay into your hands\u2026 well, quickly, we had to delay a few features\u2014including Chromas. But don't worry! They'll be available soon enough in a future update.\r\n\r\nThere are a few rules in place that vary slightly depending on how many friends you queue up with:\r\n\r\nSOLO RULES\r\n2 unique champions\r\n2 unique positions (minimum 1 priority)\r\n\"Priority\" positions are dynamically chosen based on which positions need more players throughout the server. In the example below, there are already too many players vying for middle and bottom, so you'd have to swap one pick to a lesser-chosen position in order to enter the queue.\r\n\r\n2\u20134 PLAYER PARTY RULES\r\nAll solo rules apply to each player\r\nMinimum of 1 unique champion per player across the party\r\nPrimary slot selections must be unique across the party (champion and position)\r\n5 PLAYER PARTY RULES\r\n1 unique champion per player across the party\r\n1 unique position per player across the party\r\nYou can all run it down mid together once the game has begun, but you'll all have to lock in a single unique champion for a single unique position before joining up.\r\n\r\nBecause One-for-All is a totally different game mode.\r\n\r\nOTHER DIFFERENCES\r\nOnce the game starts, the differences between Quickplay and any other game mode are minimal.\r\n\r\nYou'll get visual indicators of your assigned lane when the match starts\r\nSurrender votes are available starting at 10 minutes (4-out-of-5 players required, reduced to 3-out-of-5 at 15 minutes)\r\nLike Blind Pick before, there's a chance of the same champion(s) being on both teams\r\nBesides those small differences, it's just like any other Summoner's Rift match.\r\n\r\nWHEN IS QUICKPLAY MODE COMING OUT?\r\nQuickplay is already available on the PBE and will have a staggered release to live service starting Patch 13.22.\r\n\r\nQUICKPLAY MATCHMAKING\r\nAt its heart, Quickplay is just the evolved version of Blind Pick\u2014which is why it'll use the same MMR you had for Blind Pick.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68db7e41-ef99-401b-8404-3f8dc56b84d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "68db7e41-ef99-401b-8404-3f8dc56b84d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9979e851-de39-4f2a-8bcf-693998a14915", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "23fa53a42f9a693d36f88e5eef4ba14c5ea9e5a7e2f012d3e2095758b5448ef1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a70850a-fe5c-4fad-8198-bafceff685e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "49484f2ab2c16a8bd47ee05d38627ef4975550a23d9a3d86b1c475aadd58e9e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "General, Quickplay Mode, What is Quickplay?\r\nQuickplay is a new queue that will replace Blind Pick and give you faster access to the game, with a faster process that asks players to make their choices up-front and then goes directly from the lobby to the game. Meaning, there is no champ select in this mode.\r\n\r\nMoving champion and position choices to the lobby gets you in game faster, with higher agency over what (and who) you play, and cutting out some of the collisions, toxicity, and complexity that comes with Blind Pick.\r\n\r\nSo if you only have time for one game, you can queue up with confidence knowing that when the queue pops, it\u2019s game on!\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Blind Pick?\r\nBP = Blood Pressure?\r\nBlind Pick was designed and optimized for fast queue times. It pushes player choice into champ select, which makes the queue pop quickly. But, there are only so many lanes. Asking players to negotiate a functional team comp with strangers, against the clock, and with limited communication tools is a recipe for friction.\r\n\r\nThis is fine for players with an auto-fill mindset, but imagine: You get home from work and just want to try out the new champ, or maybe you\u2019re getting back into League after a long break and want to ease back in on a comfort pick. For a queue with no bans, it\u2019s tough to play what you want in Blind Pick.\r\n\r\nSome players bypass the negotiation altogether by locking in first. This gives an unfair advantage to those with the fastest fingers and it forces everyone else to fill in what\u2019s left or leave.\r\n\r\nTrust\r\nExperimental players and folks who just want to practice have multiple hurdles to overcome in Blind Pick. Say they want to try out Warwick mid\u2014not only do they need to get lucky in champ select with both position and champion choices, but they also risk queue dodges for their unorthodox pick. Get right onto the Rift and show `em who\u2019s a good boy.\r\n\r\nNot-so-welcome to Summoner\u2019s Rift\r\nPlayers who are newer to the game have an even harder time with this setup. They have limited champion pools and narrow positional flexibility. If they get forced into jungle because their teammates lock in everything else, we can't be too surprised when they end up in lane because they don\u2019t know where to go.\r\n\r\nAnother one\r\nLast but not least, when the game is clearly over and you just want to go next before the tilt sets in, the current surrender rules make it tough to get out and play another match.\r\n\r\nAll that said, we think the original promise of getting into a game of SR at light speed is still valid and valuable. That's what we want to deliver... minus the bad stuff. Now, let\u2019s get into the details.\r\n\r\nHow does Quickplay work?\r\nIn the lobby, players will choose Primary and Secondary champions and positions. Spells and loadouts can be changed from here as well by using a new menu.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the queue popping quickly, one of your position choices must be a \u201cPriority\u201d position. These are positions that are most needed by the current matchmaking pool (the UI will tell you which is needed).\r\n\r\nThe intent is that you get your first choice most of the time, but there will be times when you have to play in a Priority position. This is something we will keep a close eye on numbers-wise and tune accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere are the specific rules for different party sizes:\r\n\r\nSolo\r\n\r\n2 unique champions\r\n\r\n2 unique positions\r\n\r\nMinimum of 1 Priority position\r\n\r\n2-4 players\r\n\r\nAll solo rules apply to each player\r\n\r\nMinimum of 1 unique champion per player across the party\r\n\r\nPrimary slot selections must be unique across the party (champion and position)\r\n\r\nFull team of 5\r\n\r\nNo Secondary choices required\r\n\r\n1 unique champion and position per player across the party\r\n\r\nTo address being stuck in a lopsided match, we have lowered the surrender requirements a bit. The first surrender vote will be available at 10 minutes, down from 15, but still requires 4 of the 5 players to vote yes. Once the game hits 20 minutes, surrender will only require 3 of the 5 players to vote yes.\r\n\r\nWhile this may mean that stomps won\u2019t get to play out fully as often, that\u2019s probably a good thing for an unranked queue. The flip side is, games that go the distance will likely be closer and worth your time!\r\n\r\nThis tuning is also something we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on to make sure match times are healthy and most games don\u2019t end at 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhat are we hoping to see?\r\nWe want you to feel like this queue is a fast and easy way to enjoy SR gameplay, without the extra pre-game time.\r\n\r\nIn Quickplay, you should get to play what you want and be on the Rift shortly after hitting the Find Match button.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4649, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a70850a-fe5c-4fad-8198-bafceff685e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a70850a-fe5c-4fad-8198-bafceff685e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9979e851-de39-4f2a-8bcf-693998a14915", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "23fa53a42f9a693d36f88e5eef4ba14c5ea9e5a7e2f012d3e2095758b5448ef1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "68db7e41-ef99-401b-8404-3f8dc56b84d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f203d6ee73d78fb506b300c2e8ad79fd6710e5eb8423df5fe2acd352cdd2308", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The first surrender vote will be available at 10 minutes, down from 15, but still requires 4 of the 5 players to vote yes.

Rather than hold Quickplay\u2019s release for an extended period of time, we want to get it to you early, validate what we\u2019ve got, and work with you to improve it over time.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the timeline:\r\n\r\nQuickplay hits PBE in 13.21 dev cycle for core functionality.\r\nQuickplay release to live in the following patches after 13.21, in a staggered way, from region to region.\r\nAs always we are eager to hear your feedback.

That said, your secret Arena MMR will change depending on your performance before then, possibly resulting in greater Gladiator Point gains and quicker climbing when the Ranked season does officially start.\n\nARENA LOBBY\nQUEUE UP WITH MORE FRIENDS\nThe queue is even more expanded this time around. While jumping in solo is always an option, you'll be able to queue up in groups of 2\u20138 players. Even full 16-stacks are welcome, but you won't make any ranked progression if the lobby is just you and your buds\u2014gotta earn that climb!\n\nThe Arena experience begins the moment you enter the lobby.\n\nYou and your duo show up on one side of the lobby while the other teams appear on the right. You'll immediately notice several key differences from Summoner's Rift, such as\u2026\n\nNo Runes - Arena's tempo makes certain rune choices less meaningful, so they've been removed entirely. Besides, many of the in-game Augments feature powered-up versions of the existing runes. Use those to custom-tailor your playstyle.\n\nPreset Summoner Spells - Everybody starts with the same two Summoner Spells: Flash and Flee (which is similar to Ghost), though you'll sometimes have the option to swap out Flee via Augment.\n\nSemi-Draft Pick - One player from each team makes a pick, then those picks are revealed before each duo completes their team. Time for counterpicks!\n\nOne Bans Per Team - The first player of each team gets a ban, rounding out to 8 bans overall. To change who gets to pick the ban, swap pick order.\n\nOnce everybody's locked and loaded, it's time to enter Arena.\n\nPREPARATION PHASE\nEvery round begins with a preparation phase where you'll receive a variety of avenues to powering up, including Gold, Augments, and Anvils. Use this time to scout out the competition, stretch those wrists, or slam some Juice (irl or otherwise).\n\nROUND        BONUS        CHAMPION LEVEL\n1        500 Gold, Augment        3\n2        500 Gold        5\n3        Prismatic Anvil        7\n4        2500 Gold        9\n5        2250 Gold\nHigh Stakes: +15 Health for winning        11\n6        Augment        12\n7        Stat Anvil        13\n8        2250 Gold        14\n9        Augment\nHigh Stakes: +15 Health for winning        15\n10        Stat Anvil        16\n11        2250 Gold        17\n12        Augment        18\n13        2250 Gold\nHigh Stakes: +15 Health for winning        18\n14        2250 Gold        18\n15        2250 Gold        18\nANVILS\nYou can purchase most of the items available in Summoner's Rift once you get some Gold, but you also have access to Arena-specific items/perks through Anvils as the match goes on. They're sometimes handed out to all players as listed above, but they can also be purchased directly from the Shop:\n\nPrismatic - 4000 Gold: Randomized choice between all Prismatic items, Arena-specific gear that can take your build to the next level.\nLegendary - 2000 Gold: Randomized choice between Legendary items within your desired class (fighter, mage, etc).\nStat - 750 Gold: Randomized choices between raw stat upgrades.\nYou can re-roll an Anvil if you don't like your choices, but keep in mind this will come from the same re-roll pool as your Augments.\n\nAUGMENTS\nAugments are special game-altering effects that, once selected, apply for the rest of the current game. They come in three flavors of increasing intensity: Silver, Gold, and Prismatic.

You'll receive a small amount of health %-based true damage whenever you're standing in the fire, so try to avoid the flames if possible. If the ring closes entirely, damage ramps up significantly. If you and your opponent both somehow manage to endure the flames for another 15 seconds after they've reached peak intensity, the round will end in a tie, dealing damage to both teams.\n\nWith this version of Arena, the ring of fire's flames will leave lasting-but-unseen burns.

Your hidden Arena-specific MMR will still change behind the scenes to ensure you're getting fair matches while you climb, but becoming a true Gladiator is attainable to all players so long as you're earning Ranking Points by placing 4th or above. You'll start losing Gladiator Points for placing 5th or below once you hit Gladiator, but you'll never drop below 4000 Gladiator Points..\n\nNO DEMOTIONS\nSince Arena is coming to you fresh out of the oven, we want to emphasize fun and experimentation over a harrowing climb.

The upper right-hand corner (5) shows you which modes a challenge can be earned in.\r\n\r\nFinally, the bottom of the card (6) shows the next major reward you'll receive for leveling the challenge up to a given tier.

AND WHAT DOES ARAM MEAN?\r\nHowling Abyss is your battlefield, and ARAM is the game mode acronym which means \"All Random All Mid.\" Think of it as a single lane, no-holds-barred battle between two teams of 5. Prepare yourself as a random champion is assigned to each player in this fast-paced, team-fight heavy game mode.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES AND DIFFERENCES ON HOWLING ABYSS?\r\nARAM is unlike any other League game mode in a few different ways:\r\n\r\nHexgates: Players can use Hexgates that are accessed from their Nexus Fountain and transport them quickly to the furthest, first-tier turret. When the first-tier turret goes down, the Hexgate then transports them to the second-tier turret.\r\nCollapsing Turrets: When first-tier turrets collapse, they leave rubble to the north or south side that permanently alter the map for the remainder of the game.\r\nLittle Legend Companions: Players of Teamfight Tactics will recognize their favorite Little Legends who join their Champion on the Bridge. These companions are NPCs and just add a little cuteness and personality to every match.\r\nNOTE: CHIBI CHAMPION LITTLE LEGENDS CANNOT BE EQUIPPED IN ARAM\r\nDoing so could split open the multiverse and we can\u2019t have that!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWHAT CHAMPIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CHAMPION POOL?\r\nWe want ARAM to be the random, wild adrenaline rush. As such, the champion pool will contain all of the following 65 champions, along with the current week's free-to-play rotation. \r\n\r\nAatrox\tAhri\tAkali\tAmumu\tAnnie\r\nAshe\tBrand\tBraum\tCaitlyn\tCho'Gath\r\nDarius\tDraven\tEkko\tEzreal\tFiora\r\nFizz\tGaren\tGraves\tIrelia\tJanna\r\nJarvan IV\tJax\tJhin\tJinx\tKarma\r\nKarthus\tKatarina\tKayle\tKha'Zix\tLeBlanc\r\nLee Sin\tLeona\tLucian\tLulu\tLux\r\nMalphite\tMaokai\tMaster Yi\tMiss Fortune\tMordekaiser\r\nMorgana\tNautilus\tNidalee\tPantheon\tPyke\r\nQuinn\tRenekton\tRiven\tRyze\tSivir\r\nSona\tSoraka\tThresh\tTristana\tTryndamere\r\nTwisted Fate\tTwitch\tVarus\tVayne\tVeigar\r\nVel'Koz\tVladimir\tWukong\tXayah\tZed\r\nWHERE DID ARAM COME FROM?\r\nARAM was originally a custom game type created by players on Summoner's Rift. Because Summoner's Rift is a 3 lane map, players created a rule where all summoners had to meet up and battle in the middle. Players trusted one another to abide by certain restrictions on items, summoner spells, and returning to base. This ended up becoming so popular that it became official. Thus ARAM was born!\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD ARAM MAP?\r\nThe bridge collapsed from all of the stress and strain from the thousands of battles that took place on it.\r\n\r\nDOES THAT MEAN THE TUTORIAL MAP WILL NOW BE ON THE HOWLING ABYSS?\r\nActually, the tutorial will be over on Summoner's Rift.\r\n\r\nMatchmaking\r\nCAN I EARN XP FROM ARAM?\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nIS THERE AN OPTION TO PLAY HOWLING ABYSS IN QUICKPLAY OR DRAFT PICK?\r\nNo, these are not available for matchmade games. However, these options are available for custom games!\r\n\r\nWHY AREN'T THOSE MODES AVAILABLE FOR MATCHMAKING?\r\nBased on previous tests on the old ARAM map, the percentage of players that selected these picks modes was simply lower than the random romp we have currently. This doesn't mean these modes aren't fun though, so we encourage you to experiment within your custom games.\r\n\r\nCAN I SEE MY OPPONENTS' CHAMPIONS IN THE CHAMPION SELECT SCREEN?\r\nNope!

Note that chromas are not included in Skin Boosts. \r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU REROLL OR TRADE CHAMPIONS?\r\nIf you reroll or trade champions after a Skin Boost has been unlocked, you will still get a new random skin with your new champion pick.

There\u2019s a twofold method to our madness:\r\n\r\nPlayers have more fun in a friendly environment.\r\nTeams free of negative behavior win more games! (And who doesn\u2019t love to win?)\r\nBut taking care of your own emotional state is only half the battle. What can you do when someone else starts acting poorly? Is it even your responsibility? Why should you even care?\r\n\r\nWhen you start to feel the creep of irritation, it's important to remember Baron Nashor. He's strong. He's intimidating. Most importantly, he doesn't have a team by his side. When tilt sets in, it can be easy to idolize this lone wolf...err, lone monster. However, look at what happens to Baron when a team works together to take him down. Regardless of skill or rank, it's always easier to take down your enemies when you work together, rather than against one another\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to take down the (metaphorical) objectives and win more games as a result! Hopefully the ideas below will help you prepare for the task ahead: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF PATIENCE\r\nThere could be several situations where surrender may be the wisest option, but more often than not, surrender occurs because a team has lost the will to persevere. While a quick victory can be immensely satisfying, a game\u2019s outcome cannot be predicted at first blood. Take a deep breath and try to rally your troops before waving the white flag. There\u2019s nothing quite like a come-from-behind victory.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTEMPER YOUR EXPECTATIONS\r\nLuck can only take you so far, and victory cannot be achieved just by showing up to the Rift. Winning takes a lot of work and coordination, and you are just as likely to get cooperative teammates as your opponents. Try your best to win every game you play, but don't expect it to turn out that way every time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE\r\nEvery team has different strengths and weaknesses, and it can be counterproductive to stick to a specific play style or strategy after the champions are locked in. To paraphrase Charles Darwin, it is not the strongest that survives, nor the most intelligent, but rather the one most adaptable to change.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBETTER TOGETHER\r\nOur statistics show the likelihood of winning decreases by roughly 10% for each disruptive player on any given team. But don\u2019t be discouraged! The chance to win increases significantly with each positive person on the team. Being that pillar of tilt-proof strength is often the difference between victory and defeat.\r\n\r\nAs human beings, we are often quick to judge but slow to praise, especially when it comes to strangers. Try turning that around \u2013 highlight your teammates achievements in-game. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a game changing moment or a minor victory, words of encouragement can have a far greater impact on the outcome of the game than any critique ever could (we promise). Besides, you are nearly twice as likely to avoid getting reported while engaging in positive reinforcement!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE PERILS OF PEER PRESSURE\r\nEveryone has had a bad game. We bet you can recall a few times where everything went wrong (your team is outmatched, your enemies have Baron, you\u2019re down in gold\u2026you get the gist). It\u2019s pretty likely that in those situations, team morale was at an all time low. And just as all hope seemed lost...inevitably someone says something unkind. Talk about twisting the Noxian knife! \r\n\r\nStatistics show that people perform consistently WORSE under pressure. Losing a lane is already stressful enough without adding more negativity to the situation, so show some empathy and buff your teammate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMAKE MORALE A MAIN OBJECTIVE\r\nEnduring the frustration of your teammates can often lead to your own in-game irritation. Let's say a lane is at a disadvantage because a player gave up a few early kills. That player is probably really frustrated because they feel like they\u2019re dragging down the whole team. The worst thing to do in that moment is scold them. Instead, try finding out what resulted in those early losses and, as a team, orchestrate solutions!\r\n\r\nDid the lane get ganked by a jungler? Ward the lane for them. Did the lane get pushed directly? Gank the enemy champion. You might spend 75 or 100 gold on a ward, miss a wave or maybe even give up your own tower, but you will help the struggling element of your team catch up, and most importantly, relieve some of the natural stress that comes from losing a lane.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4681, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2a2513c-547c-4c83-8277-f2f96c5f4676": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2a2513c-547c-4c83-8277-f2f96c5f4676", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad85bf1d-e175-4e85-b70f-921819bff303", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3758f3001ca06f0df1ad846e25c0ca475f8cc74c3030f9131fa63fd8e59e3ac0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20949ecf-e3ec-4c7f-bb4e-9846b41d6024", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "087cf68c1f1037d13140832b5565cfb92d3e2fb556fd6f110765593e242184da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "MAKE MORALE A MAIN OBJECTIVE\r\nEnduring the frustration of your teammates can often lead to your own in-game irritation.

Remember, of all the resources in the game, your team's morale is the one you cannot afford to lose!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSTAND STRONG\r\nLet's be honest, situations where the teams are uneven (due to a summoner leaving the game, for example) suck. That is why we have a Leaverbuster system implemented to punish leaves, alongside after-game reports.\r\n\r\nFrustrating as it may be, a 4v5 situation is not necessarily an automatic defeat. The person who dropped out might experience an intermittent connection issue and could return shortly. Here are some tactics that you can employ in the meantime:\r\n\r\nContest objectives:\r\n\r\nYou may experience more lane pressure, so you\u2019ll need to catch up in gold quickly. Force your opponent to fight at objectives rather than pushing your towers. This way, you control the battlefield!\r\n\r\nWard your jungle:\r\n\r\nThis helps set up ganks if the opposition is pushing all lanes equally. Alternatively, this will help you dictate engagement if the enemy team does not have the vision in your jungle.\r\n\r\nEngage on your own terms:\r\n\r\nAttacking an enemy from a position where they lack vision will help enormously with target focus and dealing an extra chunk of damage in a pinch.\r\n\r\nKill the carries first:\r\n\r\nEven if you are unable to win a straight up team fight, you can still catch the Marksman/AD carry on their own, which will slow the enemy push considerably (and buy time for your teammate to reconnect).\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t be that guy:\r\n\r\nRemember. Opponents can\u2019t see disconnection messages on your team, so DO NOT BE THAT GUY!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNever give up, never surrender:\r\nPerhaps you won't win this game, and like we said before, surrender can be the right option. However, if you end the game with a positive outlook, your opponents will know that brave champions stood united, unfazed by overwhelming odds.", "start_char_idx": 3857, "end_char_idx": 6499, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05659105-8eaa-4915-9147-0df73a83857f": {"__data__": {"id_": "05659105-8eaa-4915-9147-0df73a83857f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb44e84e-f6ae-4b5e-9d46-33ab1890e036", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9f09061a5c761252070cc5a6f5935167f2e590d55535dfc06bbf1220d428ab1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07bf4f9a-2a50-4dbc-b6da-b3e3c479f5bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38fd9f92030cb18dca0a044e51fb3deb5917884f58a153c3da19256c45ec307e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "General, Choosing the Right Champion, Do you see yourself as an unstoppable avatar of destruction, or are you an immovable mountain, silent and eternal?

You can also select the pool of Champions that you want to filter the results from, i.e. owned or not owned Champions.

The recommended items for each Champion is a decent template for a standard game within the Champion's role, but you should definitely experiment to find the right build for you and your team each game. Naturally, we encourage our Summoners to experiment and try out different combinations!  If you find a build that supports your playstyle, create a custom Item Set to help you remember it for future games!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMaking a decision\r\nThe only thing better than defeating your opponents is defeating your opponents in style. - Jayce\r\nBefore you invest in a Champion, ask yourself the following questions:\r\n\r\nDo you like the look of the Champion, or its skins?\r\nDo you like the story behind the Champion?\r\nDoes this Champion's playstyle sound interesting?\r\nIf you answered yes to all 3 questions, then go for it, but remember that there's no point in buying a Champion just because of their abilities or current balance situation We're always on the lookout for necessary balance changes, so don't bet on abilities to be too strong or too weak forever.\r\n\r\nIf you want to find out more about the Champion's background and motivations, you can click on their portrait in your list of owned Champions (or in the Store). You can also preview the said Champion's skills and abilities by watching the videos in the Abilities section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFREE CHAMPION ROTATION\r\nEvery week we choose 14 different Champions that can be played for free.  We choose a variety of Champions from different roles, to help players test out Champions they might be on the fence about, or simply to help pad out a new player's roster.  If you would like to know more about how we choose the Champions for Free Rotation, you can read about it here:\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=46045\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW PLAYER CHAMPION ROTATION\r\nThere's a lot to learn in League of Legends, so it's easier for new players to start with Champions who have relatively straightforward abilities.

If this occurs close to the 3-minute mark, their team will be given a minimum of 30 seconds to type /remake (e.g. If a player hits 90 seconds of inactivity at 2:45, their team will have until 3:15 to type /remake.)\r\n3:00\u2013End of Game\t/remake is no longer available, but any /remakes initiated before 3:00 will be given at least 30 seconds to conclude.\r\nOutside of this timeline, but there are a few other rules that may determine the success of a /remake vote, or even its availability:\r\n\r\nIf a player AFKs/disconnects after their team gives up First Blood, their team will be unable to /remake.\r\n/remake votes can only be initiated once. Make it count!\r\nIn a 4v5, at least two players must vote \"yes\" for the game to end. In a 3v5 or lower, a single player can make the call.\r\nOnce the vote passes, the game ends. You'll neither gain nor lose LP/BE/XP, and you won't see a win or loss on your record\u2014only the inactive players (and Diamond IV and above players in their premade) are punished.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a game that goes through a /remake will not count for any features that require a player to reach a number of completed games. This includes low priority queue, unlocking icons or other content, and more.\r\n\r\nPenalties\r\nIf you're the inactive player in a match, you'll receive the following penalties:\r\n\r\nA loss on your record; if you were in a promo series, you'll lose one game towards it.\r\nLP loss, just as though you'd lost the match.\r\nYour account will be flagged by LeaverBuster, the same way as if you'd disconnected from a normal match.\r\nFor Diamond IV and above, if someone in your premade is the cause of a /remake, you'll take the same penalties they do.\r\nFAQ\r\nWHAT HAPPENS AFTER A /REMAKE VOTE IS SUCCESSFUL?\r\nThe game ends with both Nexuses safe and sound. All players enter the end-game lobby and are free to play again. Disconnected players are penalized by LeaverBuster and incur a loss; the rest go on penalty-free.\r\n\r\nISN'T THE PLURAL OF NEXUS NEXI?\r\nNo. It's like octopuses.\r\n\r\nDO EXECUTIONS AFFECT /REMAKE?\r\nExecutions won't stop a /remake, only a PvP kill will. Still, walk toward the enemy towers at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF A PLAYER DISCONNECTS SHORTLY AFTER THE GAME BEGINS?\r\nAs long as the player is disconnected for 90 consecutive seconds, and remains disconnected up to 3:00, /remake will be an option. So, /remake is available if a player disconnects at 1:00, but not if they disconnect at 2:00.\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENS IF A PLAYER DIES DURING THE /REMAKE VOTE?\r\nDeaths after 3:00 won't affect /remake eligibility; once you're offered the option to /remake, you're free to duel that Yasuo until the game ends.

Unless you were below Honor level 2 before the new season, everyone starts between Honor levels 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nWhy does my Honor level reset to a checkpoint?\r\n\r\nPlayers who consistently fought with honor in their games and finished at higher Honor levels earn a head start to getting better rewards than those who didn\u2019t. You can see which checkpoint you\u2019re reset to on the Honor website.\r\n\r\nHONOR ORBS\r\nHow do I get Honor Orbs?\r\n\r\nYou get an Honor Orb every time you reach a checkpoint past level 3. Even though checkpoints stop after level 5, you still get level 5 Orbs at the same intervals as checkpoints. Since there\u2019s no level 6, they aren\u2019t called checkpoints.\r\n\r\nDo Orbs need keys to open?\r\n\r\nNo, they\u2019re like Capsules and entirely keyless.\r\n\r\nDo Orbs get better at every checkpoint?\r\n\r\nNo. Orbs get better at every level.\r\n\r\nDo Orbs get better as I level up in Honor?\r\n\r\nYes! Orbs have more key fragments and better rewards each time you level up.\r\n\r\nSo I dropped from Honor level 5 because of a penalty. Do I still get Orbs when I reach checkpoints?\r\n\r\nYes! You\u2019ll get an Orb for that level every time you reach a checkpoint.\r\n\r\nHONOR LEVELS\r\nDo I need to do anything special to progress?\r\n\r\nYou level up just by playing to win in your games. Show up, don\u2019t intentionally work against team, and you\u2019ll progress in the coming weeks and months. If your teammates honor you a lot, you\u2019ll get a slight bonus in progression and rewards like loading screen flairs.\r\n\r\nIf I get no Honors, do I still level up?\r\n\r\nYou will. All you have to do is show up and try to win in all your games.\r\n\r\nDoes voting for my teammates contribute to my Honor level?\r\n\r\nYes, but you\u2019ll need a little help. A whole team gets a slight bonus to their honor level if every teammate votes. Just like the game, you win or lose as a team.\r\n\r\nDo I get better rewards at higher Honor levels?\r\n\r\nYes! We heard your feedback and made sure your rewards level up when you do. Orbs and Capsules have better rewards with every level up.\r\n\r\nCan I game the system and boost to level 5 by constantly playing with a premade and honoring each other every game?\r\n\r\nNice idea. We had it too. So we specifically built Honor so potential exploits like this give you (and your friend) literally no benefit.\r\n\r\nWhen will I level up?\r\n\r\nAfter completing three checkpoints in an Honor level, the next milestone is a level up. Checkpoints begin after Honor level two and end when you reach level five.\r\n\r\nHONOR CHECKPOINTS\r\nWhat are checkpoints?\r\n\r\nCheckpoints are markers for how far you\u2019ve progressed in a level. You have to complete three checkpoints in every level before leveling up and earn a reward every time you reach one. You won't receive rewards for checkpoints at Honor level 0.\r\n\r\nWhat happens after I finish my third and last checkpoint in a level?\r\n\r\nWhen you reach your third checkpoint, you\u2019re on the way to the next milestone: a level up.\r\n\r\nWhat happens to checkpoints after level 5?\r\n\r\nCheckpoints stop after level 5. You\u2019ll still get level 5 Orbs for consistently honorable play, but since there\u2019s no level 6, they aren\u2019t called checkpoints.\r\n\r\nI'm Honor level 5 and got reset to level 2, checkpoint 3. Do I miss out on rewards?\r\n\r\nYou'll miss out on a few Honor level 2 Orbs. But you'll get to higher rewards faster, and they'll keep coming even after you're back at level 5.\r\n\r\nHONOR CAPSULES\r\nWhy do I get fewer Honor Capsules this season?\r\n\r\nWith the addition of Honor Orbs, you\u2019ll still get regular and even more consistent rewards. We decided Honor Capsules should be more exclusive and carry the best rewards so reaching the next Honor level feels extra special.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t get random Capsules like before?\r\n\r\nNope. You get three Capsules over the entire season when you reach Honor levels 3, 4, and 5.\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of rewards are in the Honor capsules?\r\n\r\nEvery Capsule will have a few key fragments, a cosmetic reward, and champion shards. Capsules have better rewards at every level up. Find out what\u2019s inside each one on the Honor website.\r\n\r\nHow do I get Honor Capsules?\r\n\r\nYou get an Honor Capsule in your level up ceremony when you reach Honor levels 3, 4, and 5.\r\n\r\nDo Honor Capsules need keys to open?\r\n\r\nNope.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4334, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e77f7418-3c34-46a4-bdd4-60850ff761bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "e77f7418-3c34-46a4-bdd4-60850ff761bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a01d5db7-951c-4914-8ad4-d1fe3de4e306", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f92ffd7d53af4adf4e3399feb1eed3ec84470865369489796d124adf8bc0bc5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc496b01-ec25-4095-a7df-a3b163dadaa0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "49c9c4f4ead8bf9c146588fb134ce738246fd33e2cd8eafbee3e96b33ddff622", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "241526b9-3348-4eba-b977-b69f79d8e44c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d31e23cc47cc6f4b991f7e4af06466887ef1f15e522143df57b95816088b773d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "With the addition of Honor Orbs, you\u2019ll still get regular and even more consistent rewards.

They're basically key-free chests.\r\n\r\nSo I got a penalty and dropped from Honor level 5. Can I get Honor Capsules again when I level up?\r\n\r\nNo. You only get an Honor Capsule once. But you will get an Orb for that level instead.\r\n\r\nKEY FRAGMENTS\r\nDo all my key fragments still drop through Honor?\r\n\r\nYes. When we updated Honor last year we decided all key fragments would drop through the new feature. That\u2019s still the case.\r\n\r\nHow do I get key fragments?\r\n\r\nGet all your key fragments by doing two simple things: Playing games, and avoiding Instant Feedback penalties like chat restrictions and bans. That's it. It's an intentionally low bar, because we want you to get your stuff. You don\u2019t need to be honored by teammates to get keys. Individual honors are connected to other rewards like loading screen flairs. Keys can drop whether you win or drop the game. Key fragments hit while browsing the client or on login. You\u2019ll also get key fragments at checkpoints and level ups.\r\n\r\nWill I just get keys by idling with the client on?\r\n\r\nNot just by idling. You need to play games to get key fragments. So for instance, If you spend your Saturday playing games and leave the client on overnight, you might wake up to a nice surprise. If you just boot up your client and don\u2019t play games, you won\u2019t get any key fragments.\r\n\r\nSo, they'll just show up sometimes?\r\n\r\nYep. Just like a fed Twitch coming out of stealth.\r\n\r\nAre there any changes to chests with Honor?\r\n\r\nJust like before, they\u2019ll be locked away for a bit if you\u2019ve been penalized, until your honor is unlocked again.\r\n\r\nHONOR RECALLS\r\nHow do I get the special Honor recall VFX?\r\n\r\nTo automatically have your normal recall swapped with a special recall showcasing your good sportsmanship, just meet one of the following conditions:\r\n\r\nReach Honor Level 5\r\nReach Honor Level 3 or above AND get honored by one or more non-premade teammate in your last game\r\nReach Honor Level 3 or above AND get honored by two or more premade teammates in your last game\r\nLOADING SCREEN FLAIRS\r\nHow do I get a loading screen flair?\r\n\r\nFirst, hit level 3. Then earn honor from two premade teammates or one stranger in one game. The flair will unlock for your next matchmade game.\r\n\r\nMy flair disappeared after one game, why?\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re meant to show off that you\u2019re coming off a great game, so they only last one game. Once you're level 3 or better, get an Honor from two premade teammates or one stranger to unlock flair in your next game.\r\n\r\nIs there a cooldown on loading screen flairs?\r\n\r\nNope. If you keep earning honors, you'll keep your flair across each game you rock the Rift and earn honors.\r\n\r\nWill I get a different loading screen flair per category?\r\n\r\nNot today, but that's a damn good idea.\r\n\r\nDo they get bigger like Champ Mastery?\r\n\r\nThey do! At level 4 and 5 the flairs grow.\r\n\r\nPENALTIES AND LOCKS\r\nHow do I drop a level in Honor?\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll only drop if you receive a penalty. A chat restriction knocks your Honor level to 1 if you're at level 2 or higher, or down to 0 if you\u2019re already at level 1. A two week suspension will drop your level to 0 (even if you were higher). In both cases, your honor progress will be locked, making your account ineligible for hextech crafting rewards. Your honor progress will unlock some time after your restriction as long as you show signs of reform.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by lock my Honor level and rewards?\r\n\r\nYou'll see a lock on your Honor level in your profile.

You\u2019ll get a notification when you\u2019ve unlocked your Honor level.\r\n\r\nWhat's the deal with level 1 and 0?\r\n\r\nIf you fall below level 2, you were hit with a penalty or two, and the first step is to put in clean games to unlock your Honor level. Once you do, your games help you climb back to better rewards, just like how it\u2019s worked since Loot launched.\r\n\r\nAre rewards cut for these levels?\r\n\r\nAt level 1, you earn many less key fragments than normal. At level 0, also known as Dishonorable, you don't get any keys. It\u2019s a bummer, but you can bounce back just by getting clean games in.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\nHow does Honor work if I transfer my account across servers?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Honor won\u2019t transfer. You\u2019ll start on your new server at level 2.\r\n\r\nWhat happens to my old honor ribbons?\r\n\r\nThey're going away because this is a total system overhaul.

Clash is a monthly tournament. This competitive game mode sees you and four fellow players team up to compete against other teams at your skill level.\r\n\r\nYou can begin forming your team on Monday of Clash Week, but matches will take place on Saturday and/or Sunday. Your team can join an 8-team bracket on either day (or on both!) If you win all three games, you'll get a trophy and awesome prizes! The more games you win, the better your prizes will be! And, if your team loses the first round, you can still play consolation games to keep improving your prize pool.\r\n\r\nYour team can only join one Clash bracket each day, and once you've joined, that team is locked in for the entire bracket. However, if things don't go well for you on Saturday, you can still come back Sunday and try again (with the same team, or even a new one!)\r\n\r\nCLASH SCHEDULE (2024)\r\nCoordinating five players to play an evening of Clash can be like wrangling poros, but at least with this schedule you'll be able to plan ahead.\r\n\r\nCLASH EVENT\tPATCH\tTEAM FORMATION BEGINS\tTOURNAMENT DAYS\r\nNoxus Cup\t14.2\tJanuary 22\tJanuary 27\u201328\r\nShurima Cup\t14.4\tFebruary 19\tFebruary 24\u201325\r\nARAM Cup 1\t14.6\tMarch 18\tMarch 23\u201324\r\nPiltover Cup\t14.7\tApril 8\tApril 13\u201314\r\nMSI Clash\t14.9\tApril 29\tMay 4\u20135\r\nARAM Cup 2\t14.12\tJune 10\tJune 15\u201316\r\nDemacia Cup\t14.14\tJuly 15\tJuly 20\u201321\r\nShadow Isle Cup\t14.15\tAugust 5\tAugust 10\u201311\r\nARAM Cup 3\t14.17\tAugust 26\tAugust 31\u2013September 1\r\nZaun Cup\t14.22\tNovember 11\tNovember 16\u201317\r\nARAM Cup 4\t14.24\tDecember 9\tDecember 14\u201315\r\nDates can sometimes change, so always check in-client for the latest, most accurate information.\r\n\r\nCREATING YOUR TEAM\r\nTo join or create a Summoner's Rift Clash team, you need to have:\r\n\r\nReached level 30\r\nCompleted placements in at least one Summoner's Rift ranked queue this year or the year before. Both splits will continue to be included following Patch 13.14 when the Ranked Split changes go live (Eg. For Season 2023 Split 2, players must have completed placements in at least one Summoner's Rift ranked queue out of the following splits:\r\n2023 - Split 2\r\n2023 - Split 1\r\n2022 - (Any Split)\r\nVerified your League account by SMS (this is a new Clash-specific feature, and only mobile/prepaid numbers will be accepted. Internet numbers [VOIP] like Google Voice will not work.)\r\nARAM Clash still has the account level 30 and SMS verification requirements, but you don\u2019t have to play any ranked to participate. ARAM mains rejoice!\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThere is no Honor Level restriction for Clash.\r\n\r\nEach team has a captain who is responsible for adding or removing members, and setting up their team for Clash. Captains can start inviting their squad from the Monday before a Clash tournament. In the Clash tab, they'll pick a team name, logo, and tag to represent their team for the weekend. If more than one teammate owns a specific team logo, you'll unlock chromas of that logo.\r\n\r\nYour team will also be assigned a Tier based on your skill. Tier I is the highest, and Tier IV is the lowest. Tiers are based on everyone on the team's Rank, but it is weighted more heavily towards the best player on the team.

Internet numbers (i.e. VOIP) like Google Voice will not work.\r\n\r\nAs a measure against smurfing, you're required to input a valid mobile phone number to participate in Clash. You can remove your number from your account at any time. Just keep in mind that a 6 month waiting period begins the moment you unlink your account. If you ever want to re-link the same number, you'll have to first unlink and then wait 6 months before linking again (no jumping between multiple accounts). When you enter a phone number, you'll be sent a code to verify your account. Repeated incorrect code entries will temporarily lock you out of the verification step. This feature is for Clash only, and is not considered multi-factor authentication.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to add your country code to your number. You can find country codes here. \r\n\r\nYou can verify your account through SMS in the Settings menu or in the Clash tab.\r\n\r\nA Clash tournament is only competitive if you get to play against people of your skill level. Smurfing is something we take very seriously in Clash. You can read more about smurfing here. If you play on multiple accounts, be sure to only SMS link your highest-ranked account.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out our page on SMS Verification.\r\n\r\nBRACKET FORMAT\r\nWhen your team enters Clash, you\u2019ll be placed into a single-elimination 8-team bracket against teams at the same skill level. Whether your team wins that bracket or not, you can still come back the next day and try again in another 8-team bracket!\r\n\r\nOn each day, there is also a consolation (lower) bracket held for teams who lost the first match of each day to continue playing. Those teams will face off against the other teams that lost to earn better prizes.\r\n\r\nParticipation is flexible--you can enter on any day of the tournament. If you win Saturday, but can't play Sunday, that's cool. You can still earn the best prizes in one day (though you'd earn more if you won on both days).\r\n\r\nLOCKING IN\r\nYour team can lock-in at any time after Lock-in opens for your Tier. Tier IV can lock-in at any time of the two-hour lock-in window, Tier III can lock-in a half hour later, Tier II can lock in after another half hour, and Tier I can only lock-in for the last half hour. These restrictions help ensure we have enough teams to make quality brackets for everyone.\r\n\r\nMATCHMAKING TIERS\r\nUnlike ranked, teams will be assigned a tier for the duration of the weekend. The tiers will roughly divide teams into four sections - Tier IV at the lowest and Tier I at the highest. These tiers are \u201cbottom-weighted\u201d, so there\u2019ll be more players in Tier IV. You\u2019ll see your team\u2019s tier adjust as you add or remove players.\r\n\r\nIndividual tiers are determined by your Flex or Solo/Duo ranking - and at launch, you\u2019ll also have a rating that is derived from your previous Clash history. Team tiers take a weighted average of the roster, but it heavily prioritizes the highest-skill players\u2014so it\u2019s likely that comps of players with vastly different skills may have some tougher matches ahead. You\u2019ll see a popup if your team has a mixed skillset.\r\n\r\nTeams of different tiers won\u2019t meet during the same weekend\u2014consider each tier a totally separate tournament.\r\n\r\nSCOUTING\r\nBefore the match begins, you'll encounter several features to help you figure out the best strategy to claim victory. First up is the scouting page, where you can check out stats and info about your opponents to help your pick/ban strategy.\r\n\r\nclashbeta_scouting.png\r\n\r\nYou'll see your opponents' win rates and KDAs with their most-played champions in ranked, their best champs in terms of mastery, and their previous Clash data, too.", "start_char_idx": 3114, "end_char_idx": 7756, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53b623df-f776-47d4-99d6-7a4e065b29c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "53b623df-f776-47d4-99d6-7a4e065b29c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "424113da-9e71-476e-bc76-6278903c17e0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60a11af0a35195fa1357a4803734a801cfd027a41ddc00bc04c05094733c436b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "46b9a95b-c5e2-4dd0-8cb3-cc09a98aa02d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ccbf8cfed2ae778c8382d389816d7ed36ee72e2e1b703e43619e3a8a96059e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a92e38b9-d9e9-427f-a97e-2f6b50e24fbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca5d9eef1e050426d27115eea4e2beceedbe6fc59a0ce3d778162baa1bcfe73c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Team tiers take a weighted average of the roster, but it heavily prioritizes the highest-skill players\u2014so it\u2019s likely that comps of players with vastly different skills may have some tougher matches ahead.

Don't get caught off-guard! The team captain makes all the ban decisions for the team.\r\n\r\nAll champions are unlocked in Clash, so don't worry about figuring out that complicated three-person trade from solo queue.\r\n\r\nUnlike regular games, not declaring or hovering a champion will lock in a random champion for you\u2014we want you to avoid dodging where possible. Hovering a champion will lock in the same one where possible.\r\n\r\nSUDDEN DEATH\r\nClash also features a \"sudden death\" mode to keep matches at a fixed length. After 60 minutes, towers will become more fragile and easy to push. By 65 minutes, structures will start to damage themselves at a fixed rate in order (towers in order, then inhibitors, then nexus turrets, then the nexus). By 70 minutes, one team will have won the game. This is considered a last resort and is very unlikely to happen, but we need to give all Clash matches a fixed maximum length.\r\n\r\n/PAUSES AND /REMAKES\r\n/pause and /remake are disabled in Clash. We know this isn't an ideal experience, but matches cannot be overrun or be remade to prevent extended days of play. There's a potential for griefing or trolling through abuse of these features.\r\n\r\nTICKETS\r\nYou'll need either a Basic or Premium Ticket to enter Clash. A Basic Ticket lets you participate, but if you're confident, a Premium Ticket will offer even greater prizes. Each teammate chooses their own Ticket entry and their individual rewards scale off that. Once your Basic or Premium Ticket is set (when your full team locks in before a match), your entry can't be changed.\r\n\r\nYou can get tickets from missions, a teammate, or the store. Every two tournaments (once per theme), completing the Clash mission unlocks a ticket. A teammate can offer a ticket to anyone else on their team roster. In the store, you can purchase Basic Tickets with Blue Essence or RP, and Premium Tickets at a higher RP cost.\r\n\r\nTickets are a method of entry unique to Clash. We're introducing ticket entry for a couple reasons. We hope that all teams are committed to see each tournament through, and tickets are a way to keep the games high-stakes.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between Basic and Premium Tickets is the prize pool you're playing for. A Basic Ticket nets basic rewards, and a Premium Ticket upgrades your prize (read more below).\r\n\r\nYou can always go here to get your ticket!\r\n\r\n \r\nPRIZES\r\nRewards in Clash come in three main forms: Trophies, Victory Points (VP), Orbs, and Capsules.\r\n\r\nWinning a bracket earns you a Trophy of the corresponding tournament theme:\r\n\r\nClash_Trophies.jpg\r\n\r\nYour highest-level trophy shows up at the nexus for all your Summoner's Rift games for two weeks after the tournament ends. After that, it's time to win a new one! Trophies from the current season will also display on your profile page.\r\n\r\nVICTORY POINTS & BANNER FRAMES\r\nEvery time you win, you'll earn 400 Victory Points, which you'll use to unlock Banners. Banners are a type of reward which shows up on Summoner's Rift and in your profile.\r\n\r\nVICTORY POINTS\tREWARD\r\n400 VP\tBanner Level 1\r\n600 VP\tTheme Logo 1\r\n1000 VP\tBanner Level 2\r\n1400 VP\tBanner Level 3\r\n2000 VP\tTheme Logo 2\r\nDemacia_Banners.jpg\r\n\r\nYour VP scales on the tier your team plays in (higher tiers earn a first-win VP bonus) and your personal ticket entry.

Since 2012, passionate college students have worked diligently to create local communities that come together to celebrate gaming culture and League of Legends. Find out how you can get involved!\r\n\r\nThe League of Legends Club Program\r\nWHAT IS THE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS COLLEGE CLUB PROGRAM?\r\nThe League of Legends College Club Program (formerly uLoL) was created to support and empower League of Legends communities on college campuses all over the U.S. and Canada. These communities comprise passionate, enthusiastic students who share one thing in common: a love for League of Legends. Clubs are run by collegiate Organizers who strive to create memorable and engaging experiences for all of their members through social events, tournaments, parties, mentorship programs, and informal get-togethers. They're run by students for students; Riot simply provides support and guidance where possible.\r\n\r\nIS THERE A LEAGUE OF LEGENDS CLUB AT MY SCHOOL?\r\nThere might be! Check your School's Club Listings to Find out\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends Club Registration\r\nHOW DO I START A CLUB?\r\nWhile multiple League of Legends Clubs are allowed at one school, we encourage you to integrate yourself into an existing club if one has already been created. If you've discovered that there's no club on your campus and you believe you have what it takes to be a great Organizer, registering a League of Legends Club is simple, but there are a few things you should have ready before you start:\r\n\r\nIdentify who your fellow officers will be, and get their names and emails.\r\nCompile basic information about your university.\r\nIf your club already exists and you are simply re-registering for a new academic year, compile your club's basic information.\r\n(Optional) Reach out to a member of your school's faculty prior to starting the club. While this isn't a mandatory step in the registration process, a Faculty Advisor should be able to help you navigate any roadblocks that arise with your school or administration\r\nNow that you've got all the info ready it's time to register your club via Riot's College Club Officers Discord Server.\r\nDO I HAVE TO HAVE AN ALREADY-ESTABLISHED CLUB TO REGISTER?\r\nNope! In fact, registering your club is a great way to set the foundation and start growing a community at your school.\r\n\r\nCAN I START A CLUB IF I'M NOT A FULL-TIME STUDENT AT A UNIVERSITY?\r\nPart-time students are welcome to start a club, but you need to be registered with your university and currently attending classes.\r\n\r\nHOW MANY OFFICERS CAN MY CLUB HAVE?\r\nLeague of Legends Clubs can have up to five registered officers in the Collegiate Program. If you have a particularly large club and would like to have unofficial officers in addition to your registered five, that's fine with us!\r\n\r\nHOW DO I UPDATE MY CLUB'S INFO?\r\nIt's normal for things like mailing addresses, club leadership, and contact information to change. It's important for you to keep your information up-to-date to ensure we're able to contact you if necessary, so reach out to the admins in the College Club Officers Discord server whenever you need to make a change!\r\n\r\nDO I HAVE TO REGISTER MY CLUB EVERY YEAR?\r\nWe start off every academic year with a blank slate, so you'll need you to register your officers even if they're the same as last year. If none of your club info has changed, registration should be a breeze!\r\n\r\nCAN I REGISTER MY SCHOOL IF IT IS LOCATED IN A COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND CANADA?\r\nIf you're from a country outside of the NA Region, please submit a support ticket and we'll do our best to get you in touch with someone from your region. Just keep in mind that each region runs their collegiate program a little differently.\r\n\r\nCAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REGISTER A CLUB?\r\nRight now registration is just for college communities, and we're not supporting high school clubs in the same way.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\nCAN RIOT CREATE CUSTOM ART OR SWAG FOR MY CLUB OR SCHOOL?\r\nUnfortunately, we cannot accommodate these kinds of requests due to the sheer number of schools that participate in the League of Legends College Club Program.\r\n\r\nCAN I USE THE RIOT LOGO ON A FLYER/BANNER/SOCIAL MEDIA SITE?\r\nRiot does not sponsor collegiate events, so please refrain from using the Riot logo on any art assets you own or create.

While we've done our best to boil it down to simple tiers and divisions, the question remains: how does the game determine which tier you belong in?\r\n\r\nTo understand the answer, we must look to the number that holds it all together: MMR.\r\n\r\nMMR\r\nYour Matchmaking Rating (MMR) is what Riot uses to determine your place on the ladder and match you up with similarly skilled players. Win, and it goes up! Lose, and it goes down. Which probably leaves you wondering...\r\n\r\nWHAT'S MY MMR?\r\nYour MMR is...a secret!\r\n\r\nMMR has been custom-tailored to work with the backend systems that help place you into fair games. Removing it from these systems strips away a lot of its context, making it less useful to players as a hard indicator of skill. That's why we've created another system to help translate your hidden MMR into a more relatable format: ranks.\r\n\r\nMMR VS RANK\r\nIf MMR is your overall skill level, rank is a fluid representation of your current position on the path to fulfilling that potential. It helps contextualize where you are on the ladder relative to other players, and also offers meaningful progression in the form of tiers and divisions.\r\n\r\nThe interplay between your MMR and your rank may be hidden, but the results can be seen through another system that ranked players are intimately familiar with: LP\r\n\r\nLP\r\nLeague Points (LP) are how you move through the ranks. They are rewarded for victory and deducted upon defeat. You generally need 100 LP to climb up each division, though there are other rules governing your progression that you can read about in our article on placements, promos, and more.\r\n\r\nThey're also how we bridge the gap between your MMR and your rank, which can result in big differences between how much LP you gain or lose each game.\r\n\r\nTo get a better idea of how your MMR and rank can affect your seasonal climb, check out the video below.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill not sure how it all works? Read on for more details!\r\n\r\nABOUT EQUAL LP GAINS/LOSSES : MMR = RANK\r\nIf you are winning about the same amount of LP in victory as you lose in defeat, that means your MMR and rank are just about even. In other words, the system has determined your current rank is an accurate reflection of your skill level.\r\n\r\nWant to prove the system wrong? Then just keep winning more than you lose! Both your MMR and your rank will rise with each victory, ensuring a slow and steady climb. Just be cautious when using your overall win rate to assess your climbing potential! If you're at 55% win rate after a steady climb through a few hundred games but your LP gains are slowing down, that likely means you had a higher win rate earlier in your climb and something closer to 50% at your current position.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a quick ascent, then you're gonna have to turn up the heat.\r\n\r\nBIGGER LP GAINS, SMALLER LP LOSSES : MMR > RANK\r\nWhen your MMR is significantly higher than your rank, the system will attempt to push you up to your rightful position on the ladder with greater LP rewards upon victory and smaller deductions upon defeat. This will almost always happen at the start of each new ranked season, as you'll begin your climb at a lower rank than you ended it last season. Your MMR, however, remains at exactly the same spot, so winning will push you quickly through the ranks!\r\n\r\nOnce your MMR and rank have equalized, however, you'll begin to see smaller LP gains and bigger losses until the two are about the same. At that point, you'll need to win a ton of games in a row to signal to the system that you belong in a higher rank. Win enough, and you'll start getting bigger LP rewards to help you reach your true rank more quickly. This will continue until your wins and losses begin to even out, at which point the system determines you've hit the appropriate rank and LP gains/losses will equalize.\r\n\r\nSMALLER LP GAINS, BIGGER LP LOSES : MMR < RANK\r\nThough we try our best to give both teams about a 50% chance of winning every game, your win record may not reflect that. And that's okay! There are lots of reasons you might find yourself on a cold streak. Maybe you've been trying a new champ or position, you're rusty after taking a long break, or it's just plain old bad luck.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, getting multiple losses in a row signals to our system that your rank and MMR are no longer in sync.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4459, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "375b7070-8e46-4789-9237-297734b86d3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "375b7070-8e46-4789-9237-297734b86d3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "beec7a77-2c28-4354-b3c2-9fe4b5c7d828", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6352a211711932d0ef0b0604e461755c3a95a8dc345331f4c6f26a69812a9028", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "03882989-452b-480f-995c-fdc2f6ad579f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73f5915979e063463339b36ebc6941649910f973f02566a06879cbb8b6363a12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Win enough, and you'll start getting bigger LP rewards to help you reach your true rank more quickly.

Maybe you've been trying a new champ or position, you're rusty after taking a long break, or it's just plain old bad luck.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, getting multiple losses in a row signals to our system that your rank and MMR are no longer in sync. In an effort to fix this disparity, you'll lose more LP each defeat until your winrate levels out.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself in this situation, consider taking a break or switching to a more comfortable champion.\r\n\r\nCONSOLATION LP (AFK/LEAVING/INTENTIONALLY FEEDING TEAMMATES)\r\nLosing because one of your teammates goes AFK, leaves the game, or runs it down mid to feed the enemy, stinks. Not only does it feel bad, but it also alters your rank in a way that just isn't fair. That's why we may award consolation LP for players in this situation, provided the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\nYou're on the losing team\r\nYou lost LP (you won't be given Consolation LP if you're at 0 LP in division IV of your tier)\r\nAnother player on your team was reported and verified for AFK/Leaving/Intentional Feeding that game\r\nThe disruptive player is NOT part of your premade group\r\nIf you check all the above boxes, watch your LP animation after the game and you should see a little Consolation LP boost! Just note that you can only be awarded so much Consolation LP each week, so if you're experiencing an unusually bad streak of 4v5s, it might not hurt to consider taking a short break.\r\n\r\nDisruptive behavior outside of Ranked is also punished and affected players are compensated, but it varies in these games since there is no LP to gain/lose. Learn more about Disruptive Behavior Repair.\r\n\r\nOTHER REASONS LP MAY VARY\r\nThere are a few other reasons your LP gains/losses may deviate from their standard numbers:\r\n\r\nA system-wide issue triggers loss-prevention, which also caps LP gains\r\nAFK/Leaver penalties can reduce your LP not only for the game you went AFK in, but also for the game after\r\nYou have larger or smaller than average odds of winning a single game due to rank disparities on one or both teams or other advantages/disadvantages\r\nNo matter what the situation, we always aim to make the amount of LP you gain or lose feel fair.\r\n\r\nQUEUES & MODES\r\nIn order to accurately reflect the unique expectations of each queue, you have a different MMR for Normal, Solo/Duo, and Flex. That means you don't have to worry about a rough streak of losses in Flex altering your Solo/Duo MMR, though your initial placement in Ranked will take your Normal MMR into consideration!.\r\n\r\nQUEUING WITH FRIENDS\r\nForming a party and jumping into ranked with friends is a great way to test your skills along with your friendships, but it also changes the way matchmaking works. Queueing with somebody you know confers certain advantages that the system takes into account when creating your games, so you may see slightly more difficult opponents or reduced LP gains.\r\n\r\nOther Ranked Resources\r\nHave questions about other aspects of Ranked?

And in a lot of ways, League is no different! Whether you're a weekend warrior or dial in daily, there's a place for you on the Rift.\r\n\r\nBut that still begs the question: where exactly do you fall on that spectrum? To find out, you'll have to learn about tiers and divisions!\r\n\r\nranked infographic.png\r\n\r\nTiers & Divisions\r\nFairness and progression are the heart of competitive play. So in order to ensure fair matches and provide goals for ambitious players, we created a system that translates the chaos of individual league matches into a more structured path\u2014a path consisting of tiers and divisions.\r\n\r\nTIERS\r\nInstead of a single towering summit, it's helpful to visualize the many tiers of Ranked as a sprawling mountain range. Each peak conquered is a triumph!\r\n\r\nTiers.jpg\r\n\r\nRanked players are divided into ten tiers, shown above in ascending order. Each one houses players of similar skill levels and follows a simple rule: the more you win, the higher you'll climb!\r\n\r\nBut tiers can only tell you so much. After all, the player who just broke out of Silver probably won't be on the same level as the one on the cusp of Diamond glory, so how do you tell the difference between a couple of Golds?\r\n\r\nDivisions, that's how!\r\n\r\nDIVISIONS\r\nEach tier is more than a destination\u2014it's a journey, and divisions are your stops along the way. \r\n\r\ndivisions.jpg\r\n\r\nTiers Iron through Diamond each have four divisions. You must complete one division to reach the next, and will usually start in the lowest division upon reaching a new tier. If you're in Silver III, for example, you'll have to climb through Silver II and Silver I before breaking through to Gold IV!\r\n\r\nShould you have the misfortune of dropping a tier (it happens to the best of us!), then you'll start in the highest division of the next tier down. In the example above, perhaps you've hit a cold streak after hitting Gold IV. Lose enough games, and you'll drop to Silver I.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, plenty of exceptions and extra complexity to how this climb works, which you can read up on by visiting our article on placements, promos, and more!\r\n\r\nMASTER, GRANDMASTER, AND CHALLENGER\r\nIf you've hit Master, whoa. Nice work! You're in the top .2% of players worldwide, and that's no small feat!\r\n\r\nBut that also means you're climbing with a special set of rules created to accommodate the heightened stakes of top-tier play, which you can find on our page about Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger!\r\n\r\nQueues\r\nRanked is divided into two different queues, each with its own purpose and set of restrictions.\r\n\r\nSOLO/DUO\r\nIf your motto is \u201cwin lane, win game,\" then this is the queue for you. Whether you jump in alone or with a friend, Solo/Duo is the best place to test your mechanics, game sense, and on-the-fly communication with like-minded individuals. Nobody you meet in Solo/Duo queue will be grouped with more than one other person, so each game is an opportunity to coordinate with fresh allies against a new batch of foes.\r\n\r\nYour rank in Solo/Duo queue is totally independent of your rank in Flex, and you\u2019ll earn rewards unique to your Solo tier at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nRESTRICTIONS\r\nduo queue restrictions jpeg.jpg\r\n\r\nSince Solo/Duo is more focused on individual performance, there are limitations on who you can queue with.\r\n\r\nIRON\u2014MASTER\r\nMost players can queue with friends within one tier of their rank, but these restrictions start a little loose at lower ranks and get tighter the higher you go. For example, Iron players can queue with players up to two tiers their senior! But ascend to Diamond, and your buddy must be within two divisions to join your party. If you hit Master, you can duo with only Diamond I and other Master players. \r\n\r\nGRANDMASTER+\r\nReaching Grandmaster tier is a tremendous accomplishment, but it's also the start of a whole new journey where only the best can ascend. That's why players in Grandmaster or higher must queue alone. There's only room for one at the top!\r\n\r\nGRANDMASTER+ MMR RESTRICTIONS\r\nIn the interest of fairness, players with an MMR of Grandmaster or higher will be subject to the same solo-only restrictions regardless of rank.\r\n\r\nFLEX\r\nIf Solo/Duo queue is all about personal progression, Flex is the soul of teamwork.

So while you can queue for Flex in groups of 1, 2, 3, and 5, parties of 4 will have to stick to unranked matches.\r\n\r\nWe should also note that creating parties with large rank disparities (eg. an Iron player grouping with a Diamond player) may result in more difficult matchups as the system attempts to balance out the difference in skill levels.

Some of this information also applies to the other Ranked tiers, so check out these articles to learn more about the following:\r\n\r\nRanked Queues\r\nMMR & LP\r\nMatchmaking\r\nSeasons, Splits, & End-of-Season Rewards\r\nKey Differences for Apex Players\r\nWith < 1% of players ever reaching this level of competitive gameplay, the rules and systems in place are a bit different for Apex ranks. \r\n\r\nFor starters, Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger tiers are a single division league. Once you climb into Master, it\u2019s you versus every Apex ranked player in town. Players can reach Master by way of Solo/Duo or Flex queue, but there are a few important changes to know once you get there.\r\n\r\nSOLO QUEUE LIMITATIONS\r\nMaster, Grandmaster, and Challenger players can only queue up alone for ranked solo/duo queue. \r\n\r\nFLEX QUEUE LIMITATIONS\r\nMaster, Grandmaster, and Challenger players can play Flex queue solo, duo, or in teams of 3 or 5. You cannot, however, queue with any player ranked below Emerald.\r\n\r\nApex Rank Decay & Banked Days\r\nThe Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger tiers are all subject to rank decay, which is a -75 LP per-day penalty against inactivity. Apex players can prevent decay by playing games and earning banked days.\r\n\r\nMaster players who decay due to inactivity will descend into Diamond II, not Platinum I, and will restart their climb from there.\r\n\r\nBanked days are how many decay events can pass before you start losing LP (with 1 decay event happening each night). You can see how many banked days you have in the Ranked tab of your in-client Player Profile.\r\n\r\nMaster, Grandmaster, and Challenger players bank 1 day per 1 game played and can bank a maximum of 14 days at a time. On top of needing to meet the LP requirements mentioned below, this means most Apex players are playing ranked games nearly every day to maintain their position.  \r\n\r\nFOR EXAMPLE\r\nIf an Apex player has 0 banked days and is about to go on a 2 week vacation, they\u2019ll have to play 14 ranked games the day before they leave in order to earn the 14 banked days that will protect their LP from decay while they\u2019re gone.\r\nPlease note that rank decay still occurs even when your account is banned!\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nDecay is cycled one last time on the final day of the season (decay happens at 11:45 p.m., then season ends at 12:00 a.m., for example), so we recommend having at least 1 more banked day than there are days remaining in the season.\r\n\r\nApex Promotion, Demotion, and LP Requirements\r\nUnlike the non-Apex tiers, movement between Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger is much more fluid, with players moving up and down between them on a daily basis. Once you reach Master, your goal is to keep winning games and collect enough LP to overtake other Apex players, while meeting the tier and regional requirements needed to climb. \r\n\r\nThe Grandmaster and Challenger Tier standings refresh on a rotating twenty-four hour schedule. Each time the clock hits zero (local time), it recalculates all Master+ players in the same region and reorders them based on who\u2019s met the requirements described below.\r\n\r\nThere's no upper limit on LP.

Further down we'll get into some of the challenges that can complicate this process, but we aim for no more than a 4\u20135 MMR gap between the averages of both teams in the majority of games..\r\n\r\nPOSITION PREFERENCE\r\nBefore queuing up for Ranked, every player must list two preferred positions (unless you choose \"Fill,\" you absolute legend). We'll always try to prioritize your Primary position, but your Secondary position may be used as a backup depending on matchmaking conditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, neither preference is guaranteed. In the event we can't find a full team comp at your skill level, there's a small chance you will be Autofilled. This generally happens when your queue time gets too long, which is usually because there's a shortage of one or more positions in the queue. We consider this a last resort to get you out of the lobby and into a game.\r\n\r\nQUICK QUEUES\r\nCreating fair matches is one of League's top priorities, but we also respect your time and recognize how frustrating a long queue can be. After all, you're here to play\u2014not to wait.\r\n\r\nIf your queue time is running long, that means the system is having trouble finding an appropriate match up. The longer you wait, the more the matchmaking system may stray from your MMR or swap someone's position\u2014though we'll still try to keep things as fair as possible.\r\n\r\nMatchmaking Challenges\r\nWhile we strive for fairness, preference, and speed, there are plenty of factors that can complicate those goals:\r\n\r\nMatches played during off-peak hours (smaller selection pool)\r\nParties of players with very different MMRs (harder to average and match)\r\nA shortage of one or more positions (sometimes resulting in one or more players being autofilled)\r\nThese all throw curveballs at the matchmaker, forcing it to weigh one aspect more heavily than the others.\r\n\r\nEven then, there can be other hidden elements that make a seemingly fair match feel a little unbalanced:\r\n\r\nOne or more players trying an off-position\r\nOne or more players trying an unfamiliar champion\r\nAn otherwise fair match in which one lane has an unfair matchup\r\nA few key kills early on cause a game to snowball out of control\r\nSometimes, players just have bad games!\r\nYour playstyles as a team just aren't meshing\r\nOf course, the enemy team could potentially have all the same issues, so stay focused and always give it your best! Especially when facing...\r\n\r\nHIGH-RANK OPPONENTS\r\nIt's one thing to feel a match is unbalanced, but another to actually play against opponents who are a few divisions\u2014or even a tier!\u2014above you.\r\n\r\nBut there are plenty of good reasons this may be happening!\r\n\r\nYOU'RE WINNING A LOT!\r\nIf you're being consistently placed against opponents who are a higher rank than you, then congratulations! That could mean the matchmaker is starting to suspect you're worthy of higher placement. If you're on a big win streak, you may even start to see opponents several divisions your senior!\r\n\r\nYOUR OPPONENT IS LOSING A LOT\r\nAlas, balancing goes both ways. The matchmaker is placing them against lower-ranked opponents to find them an appropriate spot on the ladder.\r\n\r\nLARGE RANK DISPARITY WITHIN A TEAM\r\nWhile the average MMR for both teams will still be roughly the same, ensuring a fair match becomes more challenging if one team has five teammates of roughly equal skill and the other team has a mix of low and high ranked players. Thankfully, this rarely happens outside of premade teams in Flex queue.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the same phenomenon can happen in Solo/Duo queue when two players with a big rank gap (Bronze IV and Silver I, for instance) queue up together. But don't worry! You have one weapon your enemies may not\u2014THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP.\r\n\r\n...Seriously, though! Make sure you take advantage of your duo queue with better planning, coordinating, and communication to stack the odds in your favor.\r\n\r\nAutofill\r\nIf you've ever played a game and gotten a position you didn't select, you've been autofilled. This usually happens when a position is low in supply during matchmaking, and it can happen for any position.

This usually happens when a position is low in supply during matchmaking, and it can happen for any position. The goal of autofill is to keep queue times reasonable and matchmaking fair.\r\n\r\nREDUCING AUTOFILL\r\nBefore we move on, let's be clear: there's no way to completely avoid autofilling.\r\n\r\nThat's why we recommend every player familiarize themselves with at least one champion in each position. In fact, this is good advice in general\u2014you might be less inclined to flame your jungler if you've spent a few games missing your own smites.\r\n\r\nThe second-best way to manage autofill is to take fate into your own hands and fill or select an autofill-protected position. Since position popularity varies by region and can shift over time, we can't definitively state which positions will be eligible for autofill. However! You can always check when you queue up by looking for the following messages below your preferred position selections:\r\n\r\nautofill-protected.png AUTOFILL PROTECTED autofill-protected.png\r\nA position you've selected is short on players, so you'll be guaranteed to get one of your top two choices. You're helping bring balance to the Rift!\r\n\r\nautofill-enabled.png AUTOFILL ACTIVATED autofill-enabled.png\r\nThe positions you've selected are in high demand, so you may be autofilled. Such is the price of popularity!\r\n\r\nRemember, autofill only activates when at least one position desperately needs players. Each time you fill, you're lightening the burden on everyone and reducing their chances of being autofilled. It's a quiet heroism, but heroism nonetheless, and it may even prevent one of your teammates from getting autofilled into one of their weaker positions.\r\n\r\nAnd if you do end up autofilled after queueing for a different position, hunker down and give it your best shot knowing that you'll be guaranteed your primary or secondary position in the next handful of games.\r\n\r\nSome final notes:\r\n\r\nIf you or someone else dodges from an autofilled lobby, you will not be protected from autofill for the next game.\r\n/remake-ing a match will count against any autofill protection you may have stored up.

Sure, every win and loss will affect your MMR, but climbing\u2014or even falling!\u2014between tiers might also be on the line. As might be your starting position on the ladder!\r\n\r\nPlacements\r\nPlacement matches are how we determine your starting position on the current season or split's Ranked ladder. You'll only play them if you're unranked, which happens if you've never played Ranked before or if it's the start of a new season/split.\r\n\r\nYou'll have to play five placement matches in each Ranked queue to lock in your starting tier/division, which will depend on the outcome of these matches, the difficulty of the opponents you faced, and your rank from the previous season and preseason. If you participated in Ranked last season/split, know that all players undergo a 'soft reset' at the beginning of each season/split, so your new rank will likely be about a tier lower than it was at the end of the previous season/split. If you've never played Ranked before, your normal MMR will be taken into account for your placement matches. You also cannot place any higher than Diamond III, even if you were previously in one of the top tiers.\r\n\r\nYou cannot lose League Points (LP) in placement matches! Instead, you'll simply gain 0 LP upon defeat. But be sure to play with a good connection, as going AFK will also count as a loss in your placements.\r\n\r\nPromotions\r\nOnce you're placed in a division, you'll earn LP for each match you win and lose LP for each match you lose. Breaking 100 LP within a division will promote you to the next division of your current tier. You'll even hang on to any leftover LP!\r\n\r\nIf you accrue 100 LP in division I of any tier (like Iron I, Emerald I, etc), you'll automatically move into the next tier. It's as simple as that!\r\n\r\nOf course, what can be won can also be lost...\r\n\r\nDemotions and Decay\r\nWinning is the only path to promotion, but there are two ways to drop below your current division and tier: demotions and decay. \r\n\r\nDEMOTIONS\r\nDemoting between divisions within a tier (ie. Silver III to Silver IV) happens whenever you lose more LP than you have. For example, if you're at 5 LP in Silver III and lose 20 LP in a game, you'll be demoted to Silver IV with 85 LP.\r\n\r\nIf you're in division IV, however, you'll generally be able to lose several matches before being demoted to the next tier down. Just how many losses it'll take depends on your MMR, so the best way to tell whether you're in danger of demotion is by checking your Ranked emblem under the Ranked tab. A yellow warning icon indicates that you're approaching demotion, while a red icon means demotion is imminent. If you still lose at this point, you'll fall to the top division of the tier below (ie. Silver IV to Bronze I), and your LP will be set to 25, 50, or 75 LP depending on your MMR.\r\n\r\nDEMOTION SHIELD\r\nJust get promoted to a new tier and now you\u2019re worried about dropping right back down with a loss or two? Don\u2019t be! Up through Diamond, you\u2019ll be protected from demotion for your first few games.\r\nFor information on how demotion shields work at Master and higher, read our article on the apex tiers.\r\n\r\nAPEX TIER DEMOTIONS\r\nJust like promotions, demotions for players Master and higher are a little different.

If you want to keep your position, you'll have to fight for it. Let too many days go by without a match in that queue, and decay will set in, causing you to automatically lose a set amount of LP each day.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't mean you have to play every day. When you enter a division with decay (ie. Diamond+), you\u2019ll be given a number of banked days. At the end of each day, your number of banked days will decrease by one.

You'll begin each new split unranked, but you can jump back on the ladder by playing ten placement games. Once those are finished, you should find yourself at just about a full tier below your final rank the previous split, though results may vary depending on your performance in your placement games and in the preseason.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the highest you can begin a new split is at Emerald I.

How many games you'll have to play/win, however, depends on your rank.\r\n\r\nIf you're Iron, Bronze, or Silver, you'll need 1000 Split Points for that split's Victorious skin.\r\n\r\nIf you're Gold or higher, then you'll only need 80 Split Points.

Your placement is also based on your current MMR (which transfers with you) relative to the MMR of everyone on that server, which means you may end up in a different tier or division than your original server.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your old rank on your original server will be lost if you don't return within two weeks. If you decide to switch back after that, you'll have to start the process from the beginning, placement matches and all.\r\n\r\nFor more information on what does or does not come with you between servers, refer to our guide on account transfers.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4509, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf557a92-ae66-417e-b1f3-51e1ce64be48": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf557a92-ae66-417e-b1f3-51e1ce64be48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8667f072-4d29-493f-b2f6-0f0a28fd26e6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7b776f7e505dc3a704336e4def2a8166667e4ec9c698018ed3144f58b1294694", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Ranked, Queue Dodging, Every time you hit the Play button, you\u2019re entering an unspoken agreement with nine other players to set aside the next hour or so for some good ol\u2019 fashioned League shenanigans. The closer it gets to game time, the greater that commitment becomes. And while we\u2019d rather players not leave during Champ Select, we get it. Life happens! But whether you\u2019re handling an emergency or you just can\u2019t bear facing Teemo again after a string of brutal mushroom-related defeats, the penalties for queue dodging are always the same, and you should know what you\u2019re getting into.\r\n\r\nQueue dodging happens when a player in champion select decides to leave the lobby for any reason. When one player dodges, the remaining players on both teams are placed back into the matchmaking queue and the leaving player suffers a penalty depending on the game queue they are currently in.

In order to prevent abuse, missing a Ready Check too many times results in a timed queue ban, as well as an LP loss in Ranked queues. The exact penalties are described below:\r\n\r\nDeclining or missing the Ready Check too many times in a Ranked queue will result in a 6 minute ban from all queues and a loss of 5 LP.\r\nThe penalty is increased to 15 LP for continuing to miss Ready Checks.\r\nEach subsequent miss increases the length of the timed queue ban and imposes a 10 LP penalty.\r\nReady Checks penalties from any queue affects the entire account.

There is a LOT to learn, and even after learning the basics, there's still so much that varies from champion to champion and item to item. \r\n\r\nRoles and Lanes\r\nGames are 5v5, and there are 5 different roles per team.\r\nTop: Of course it is the person in the toplane.\r\nMiddle: The person in the middle lane of the map.\r\nJungle: The person that roams throughout the jungles between lanes.\r\nBottom: They are in the bottom lane\r\nSupport: Is in the bottom lane as well\r\nGeneral overview of roles, not in depth:\r\nTop: Taking towers, being tanky, and being the frontline of the team.\r\nMid: More mobile, high damage.\r\nJungle: Taking objectives that spawn, Dragons, Baron, Rift, etc Ganking lanes.\r\nBot: Is also called the ADC (Attack Damage Carry) They want to deal a lot of damage and kill the enemy.\r\nSup: Puts down wards and clears enemy wards, helps their ADC and team.Think: Healing, Shielding, etc. \r\nThe goal is to destroy the enemy's buildings. The buildings being Towers, Inhibitors, and the main unit, their Nexus in their base. The first team to blow up the enemy Nexus, wins. \r\nIn LOL, you need to level up, gain gold, and buy items to become stronger. \r\nThe Map\r\nThis is Summoners Rift, AKA, the map you play on. The labels of where the different lanes are, and where the roles go.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map has a Blue side, and Red side, as seen in the image below. You are either on the Blue or Red team, and listed below are the Towers, Inhibitors, and the Nexus for each team. As well as where the major Jungle Objectives (Dragons, Rift, Baron) spawn.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are different Jungle Plants around the map that spawn, attacking them does different things:\r\n \r\nScryers Bloom: Attack to release pollen in a cone shape that reveals enemies and wards.\r\nBlast Cone: Attack while near to explode the plant. This can send you over walls.\r\nHoneyfruit: Attack to drop 5 fruits that restore Health and Mana\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW: The Map has changed in some areas. I don't have a full image yet, but will update that when it arrives. \r\n\r\n\r\nGame Modes: \r\nThe main modes are Draft Pick and Ranked SoloDuo\r\n\r\nRanked is of course, Ranked, with different ranks from Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc Ranked uses the Draft format as described below. \r\nNormal, is just the game but it doesn't affect your rank.\r\nBlinds, just means that when everyone loads into a game, you type in the role that you want.\r\nQuickPlay, you will Select 2 Champions, and 2 Roles, the game will automatically have you join a game. \r\nWhen you play Draft, you select 2 roles you want, and it gives everyone a role, and you take turns selecting champs. Each person gets to Ban a champion, and no one can play them.\r\nARAM, means All Random All Mid, and is a fun game mode just to play here and there, same with TFT, TeamFight Tactics, that is a board game like game.\r\nArena, is a 2v2v2v2, so 4 teams of 2 people. And you fight it out in, well, an Arena. \r\nAs you can see:\r\n\r\nSummoner Spells and Runes:\r\n\r\nOnce you queue up for a game, you are going to select a lane, a champion to play, and their Runes and Summoner Spells, as well as any Skins or Chromas. \r\n\r\nSummoner Spells are these guys right here, and they are very important. They are bound to the F and D keys on your computer by default. They are each different, and serve a different purpose, and generally depending on your Lane, you are going to need specific ones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlash (the most popular, almost everyone needs it) \r\nFlash causes your champion to teleport or blink, a short distance in the direction of the cursor. Great for escaping, and getting closer to your enemy, or going over walls. \r\n\r\nHeal (generally champs in the Botlane take this)\r\nHeal instantly restores health to your champion and an ally while also granting a small burst of movement speed.\r\n\r\nGhost (Champion specific, not super super common)\r\nGhost increases your champions movement speed and grants them the ability to move through minions.\r\n\r\nBarrier (Champion specific, not super super common)\r\nBarrier shields your champion from damage for a few seconds.\r\n\r\nExhaust (Generally taken by Botlaners)\r\nExhaust slows an enemy champion, and reduces their damage dealt for a few seconds.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4316, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ce916c1-a5c1-4c9d-80c3-68dcd1ed95b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ce916c1-a5c1-4c9d-80c3-68dcd1ed95b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f033903a-8dd2-4ce1-b2ca-eae0884b5134", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfcb7c24b9bd43e56376cf9c72614e536c86d5434d2cd626e748b2ea17ac2fb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36b0bdf5-28ed-46a5-9357-0d472df28dce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "12b046a3d4a4ddba75e31ac07ffc3fdf2ec0e552a9e95d575847f2b21aeb9ef3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba480beb-f388-44df-9cf4-90e019e80b7a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb7638635a407c98604592d65c6d50c7ffba16208444fd0fea94e6b0fd5e9408", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They are each different, and serve a different purpose, and generally depending on your Lane, you are going to need specific ones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlash (the most popular, almost everyone needs it) \r\nFlash causes your champion to teleport or blink, a short distance in the direction of the cursor.

Pre-14 minutes you can teleport to towers. After 10 minutes, it can be an allied unit (wards, boxes, minions, etc)\r\n\r\nSmite (A must have for Jungler)\r\nSmite deals true damage to the target large or medium monster, enemy minion, or pet. More on this later. \r\n\r\nCleanse (Champion specific, not super super common)\r\nCleanse removes most crowd control effects and summoner spell debuffs\r\n\r\nIgnite (Generally taken by Supports, Mid, and Top laners)\r\nIgnite deals True Damage over the duration and applies Healing Reduction as well as granting True Sight of the enemy. \r\n\r\nYou will have to select them after you select your champion, along with your Runes: \r\n\r\nRunes are, well, a lot to learn. I can't teach you much, except it takes time to see which ones go on certain champs. This is a screenshot, and there are a lot, each is good and bad for certain champs.\r\n\r\nThe game automatically give you 3 recommended Runes Pages so just go with one of those until you learn more. They are complex, and in time you will learn how to pick them for matchups and your build. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter selecting your Champion, Runes, and Skin,and Ward Skin, the match is about to start. Reminder: Skins don't affect the game at all, it's just how you look. \r\n\r\n\r\nGame Start: \r\nNow the game starts. When starting, you have 500 Gold. You will purchase your starting items. Again, this depends on your champion, and lane, so I can't give you the exact item to buy. But you can do some looking, asking, see builds, etc. There's over 200 items possibly? There's a LOT. \r\n\r\nI will add, generally, these are the starting items per role: \r\n\r\nTOP - Doran's Shield or Dorans Blade\r\nMID -  Doran\u2019s Ring / Blade and Potions\r\nJUNGLE - One of the 3 Eggs, and a potion. \r\nADC - Doran's Blade\r\nSUP - World Atlus, it's a Support item.\r\n\r\nThis looks confusing, but don't worry, it's actually pretty simple. If you are new, just go with what the game recommends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you start, you are of course Level 1, and you can choose one Ability to upgrade. Every level up allows you to upgrade an ability so you can use it, or upgrade one that you have to make it stats better.\r\n\r\nAs you can see below, the Green bar is your Health. \r\nThe Blue bar is your Mana. \r\nThe number next to your image is your level. \r\nOn the right are your 6 item slots for buying items and your Gold. \r\n\r\nMana is used to cast your Abilities. Some champions have Energy instead, some do not require Mana, but most of the champs are going to use Mana for abilities. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow, after buying an item (you can only buy items when you are in your base) depending on which lane you chose, that is where you will go. Top, Mid, Jungle, Bot/ADC, and Sup based off the map above. When waiting for the match to start, you can wait in your Lane, ward an area, wait in a bush, etc. You will learn what to do with time.\r\n\r\nEach champion has a Passive, 3 Abilities, and an Ultimate, as you can see on the image above. These are going to be the keys: QWER by default. Each one has its own cooldown and mana cost. \r\n\r\nOn the right, are your item slots. When you buy items, they go here. You can buy components for an item, and combine them to a better item.

You can buy components for an item, and combine them to a better item. You will learn this with time. Some items have an Active Ability, which means you press that corresponding number, and the item will use its effect. You can see the time remaining on the actual item. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinions Spawn: \r\nThe Minions will spawn, and it's time to start. When a Minion dies near you, you get a small amount of XP (XP is what you use to level up). When you are Farming (aka killing minions to get gold and XP) you want to Last Hit them. Which is waiting until they have almost no health, and landing the killing blow on them. When you do, you also receive Gold. It will take time to learn how to farm and when to attack to Last Hit them. The bars above the minions are their health, and of course, the Red ones belong to the Red team and the Blue ones, the Blue team. You can only attack the enemies minions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are near them when they die, you get XP. This is how the Support levels up without killing all the minions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are near the enemy minions, and you have no minions nearby, they will attack you. If you are near them, and you attack an enemy, they will also attack you.\r\n\r\nIn LOL, you need to level up, gain gold, and buy items to become stronger. This is what's going to allow you to keep up with your enemies, and kill them and take objectives.\r\n\r\nIf you get too close to an enemy Tower, it will attack you. If your minions are there, it will attack them first. However if you attack an enemy while under their tower, it will target YOU instead. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you attack the Tower, you will see the health divided into chunks. Lowering their Health to one of those, will give you extra Gold! This only happens before the 14 minute mark, and this is called \u201cTurret Plating.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen in your lane, or outside of your base, you cannot buy items. In order to buy items you must be in your base, where you spawn. If you need to go back to your base, you can Recall by pressing B, and you will be sent back to the base so that you can automatically Heal, restore Mana/Energy, and buy items. \r\n\r\nGame Timing:\r\nThe game is split up into 3 \u201cSections\u201d \r\n\r\nEarly Game (Laning Phase), Mid Game, and Late Game. These are rough, and vary from game to game, but GENERALLY: \r\n\r\nEarly Game: Is from the time the game starts, and you leave the fountain, until the first tower falls, and people start to roam around the map more. Generally, this is around 14-15 minutes. In the early game, your goal is to focus on your lane, farm, get kills, and to not die. This isn't teamfighting, this is you, in your lane, doing your job.\r\n\r\nMid Game: Starts after the Early Game (Laning Phase)  is over! Let's say you are in botlane, and you take the enemy tower. You now want to Rotate (which means to go to another lane) on over to Mid. Generally, mid game is going to be about 15-25 minutes. You will focus on team fights and objectives of course, but it's not your SOLE job, you still need to be farming and taking towers. \r\n\r\nLate Game: After the Mid Game, comes the Late Game. This is when you are all focused on Objectives. Generally, this is about 25/30 minutes to the end. You keep farming when you can and pushing lanes, but the focus is on teamfights, objectives, and pushing lanes. This is when Baron Nashor is going to spawn depending on the game, and you need to take Inhibitors, and fight as a team, more so than Mid Game.", "start_char_idx": 6993, "end_char_idx": 11023, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fea11637-1554-429e-8839-b936e135d6e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "fea11637-1554-429e-8839-b936e135d6e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f033903a-8dd2-4ce1-b2ca-eae0884b5134", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfcb7c24b9bd43e56376cf9c72614e536c86d5434d2cd626e748b2ea17ac2fb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba480beb-f388-44df-9cf4-90e019e80b7a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb7638635a407c98604592d65c6d50c7ffba16208444fd0fea94e6b0fd5e9408", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae268943-e173-4dba-9f72-60160e130965", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "11271957d510350ee5590382092e35a943dbfdf8f528ce58d8b9852e82e43a7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Let's say you are in botlane, and you take the enemy tower.

This is when Baron Nashor is going to spawn depending on the game, and you need to take Inhibitors, and fight as a team, more so than Mid Game. \r\nPings: \r\n\r\nControl and dragging in a direction, brings up the Ping Wheel. Use this to communicate with your teammates. There are pings like:\r\n\r\n\u201cGroup Up\u201d\r\n \u201cCaution\u201d \r\n\u201cAll In\u201d \r\n\u201cIs Missing\u201d \r\n\u201cOn My Way\u201d\r\n\u201cPush\u201d etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can ping 3 times in a row, before it goes on Cooldown for a few seconds. Its great to get your team to let you know what you want to do. Ping \u201cAttack!\u201d on an enemy. Ping \u201cI need help!\u201d if you need your Jungler. Ping \u201cOn my way\u201d to show where you are going. \r\n\r\nIf you press Tab, you can bring up the Scoreboard, you can ping Items you have, by pressing Alt and clicking it. Same with the Shop. You can Alt press an item, to ping how much Gold you need to buy it. You can Alt click your level, or your XP bar, to let your team know how far you are from leveling up, or ping your Mana to let them know you don't have enough Mana to fight. Pings can be very useful. \r\n\r\nYou can also mute other peoples pings if they are spamming them, or mute their Chat if they are being toxic. Press Tab, and next to their picture, is a little Sound Icon, and clicking around you can mute different things. Pings are great, just dont overdo them. \r\nWarding: \r\nNow a few more things, a major job of the Support, is warding. All lanes need to place wards as well though. You can place different kinds of Wards. The main being: \r\n\r\nStealth Wards - Free - You can place up to 3, and it reveals enemies that walk in its radius, and they cannot see it. It does expire after some time. \r\n\r\nControl Wards - 75 Gold - You can place one at a time, they do not expire, and the enemy can see them. However, it will also reveal enemy Stealth Wards and hidden enemy traps. Also called Pink Wards\r\n\r\nFarsight - Places a ward far away, however, its killed in one hit, and the enemy can see it. Cannot be purchased until you are level 9.\r\n\r\nOracle Lens - Scans the area, and reveals any enemy wards and traps (think mobile Control Ward)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also get Ward Skins to change the way they look. \r\n\r\n\r\nTop Lane: \r\nGood champs to start with: Garen, Darius, Mordekesier, Nasus, Sett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop laners are usually champions that are very durable, tanky, and very hard to kill. Top Laners are further away from the objectives and the action, hence them taking Teleport to be able to get places quickly. The Junglers may come to lane and attack, but generally it's a \u201c1v1\u201d lane. \r\n\r\nThe only objective right near the toplane, as you can see on the map, is the Rift Herald / Baron Nashor / Void Grubs.\r\n\r\nAs a Top laner, you want to be getting towers (AKA Split Pushing, you taking towers while your team is elsewhere), helping with objectives, farming, and fighting the enemy. In teamfights you will be the tanky one generally, so you will be in the front and taking a good amount of damage. \r\n\r\nJungle: \r\nGoing to the Jungle side of things now, some more information: \r\n\r\nGood beginner champions: Hecarim, Warwick, Volibear, Nunu, Vi. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Junglers job is to kill the animal camps around the map to gain Gold and XP, as well as get Objectives like the Rift Herald, Dragons, Baron Nashor, etc. As well as Gank lanes to help them and possibly kill the enemy champs there.", "start_char_idx": 10290, "end_char_idx": 14198, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae268943-e173-4dba-9f72-60160e130965": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae268943-e173-4dba-9f72-60160e130965", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f033903a-8dd2-4ce1-b2ca-eae0884b5134", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfcb7c24b9bd43e56376cf9c72614e536c86d5434d2cd626e748b2ea17ac2fb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fea11637-1554-429e-8839-b936e135d6e2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "67ba1394a1c4737b8b068dd6f595e1ea5a238ab55732da58a49b2c1c9b565016", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "be95447b-ceed-44d4-9faf-0f78096dbd12", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ca3ae72c3f3b212942834719008eaacd28fc8efb36f5bcb2961854a375a5409", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The only objective right near the toplane, as you can see on the map, is the Rift Herald / Baron Nashor / Void Grubs.\r\n\r\nAs a Top laner, you want to be getting towers (AKA Split Pushing, you taking towers while your team is elsewhere), helping with objectives, farming, and fighting the enemy.

Junglers must take the Smite Summoner Spell, as seen above. They use this to kill the camps and finish them off to clear the jungle faster. The pet will help you attack camps, and when you kill them, will also heal you. \r\n\r\nJunlgers will start with (generally) either the Red Buff or the Blue Buff. If they start on the Botlane side, generally the ADC and Sup will help them kill it by attacking it a few times, making sure to not land the final blow. As when killed, it gives the person who killed it a Buff (Mana regen / Health regen / Burn). Make sure to be on time to your lane of course, so a few attacks is generally plenty. This is called Leashing. \r\n\r\nHere is a Map of the different Camps:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJungle Objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jungling, you will have to learn the best order for you to go in, as well as when to go from the jungle, and into a lane to gank the enemies in that lane. Throughout the game, Jungle Objectives spawn. These being: \r\n\r\nDragons, there are 7: Infernal, Mountain, Cloud, Ocean, Hextech, Chemtech, Elder. \r\n\r\nKilling one gives your team a buff, and it's different based on the type of Dragon. When a team kills 4 dragons, they receive an even bigger Buff called the Dragon Soul. After 4 have been killed, the next to spawn is the Elder Dragon, which is an even stronger dragon, with an even stronger buff. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, when you kill a Dragon, the map changes a little bit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVoid Grubs, are these cute guys below. They spawn at 5 minutes in the Rift Herald and Baron Nashor Alcove. There are 3 of them, and they will spawn twice throughout the game. Killing one, grants your entire team the buff \u201cTouch of the Void,\u201d If you have this buff, and attack a Tower, you will spawn little Void Mites that help attack and do more damage. There is a tad more to it, but that's the basics. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext is the Rift Herald, you can see the location on the map above. This is a Jungle Objective for the Jungler, but your teammates should also help you out with these. When killed, it drops an item you can pick up. When you use the item it spawns the Rift Herald, it charges, and does impact damage to the enemy turret (about half) and then continues attacking. \r\n\r\nYou can also click on the Rift Herald, to hop inside and steer it. If you hit enemies, they will be Knocked Up, and It will spawn Void Mites that help attack the tower, and give you a shield. When trying to kill it, attacking the eye on its back does far more damage. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Rift Herald can be killed before the 20:00 minute mark. At that time, Baron Nashor will spawn and if there is a Rift Herald in the alcove, it will despawn. When Baron spawns, the map will change slightly around it, and it gets different attacks based on one of the three forms that it takes. You will learn these with time. \r\n\r\nWhen killed, it gives you and your allies a buff, as well as any Minions that you get close to. This objective generally requires the whole team, and is very important. Teamfights will tend to happen around this objective. \r\n\r\nBaron Nashor's buff is called the Hand of Baron. It makes:\r\n\r\nYour recall channel time is about half of what it normally is.\r\nYour minions receive a speed boost, more damage, take less damage, and have more range.", "start_char_idx": 13404, "end_char_idx": 17561, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be95447b-ceed-44d4-9faf-0f78096dbd12": {"__data__": {"id_": "be95447b-ceed-44d4-9faf-0f78096dbd12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f033903a-8dd2-4ce1-b2ca-eae0884b5134", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfcb7c24b9bd43e56376cf9c72614e536c86d5434d2cd626e748b2ea17ac2fb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae268943-e173-4dba-9f72-60160e130965", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "11271957d510350ee5590382092e35a943dbfdf8f528ce58d8b9852e82e43a7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "527522a1-c8c8-4092-ba39-d878213d4da6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4017b760b47e14fbba65e18483dfb5e19c47c258e767bde757ce21c2b2084c47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "When trying to kill it, attacking the eye on its back does far more damage. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Rift Herald can be killed before the 20:00 minute mark.

Destroy the enemy Towers, destroy their Inhibitors, and eventually their Nexus. There is of course so much more to it, but this is the bare bones basics. \r\nMid Lane: \r\nGood beginner champions: Lux, Annie, Ahri, Malzahar, Veigar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are playing Mid, you are in the center of the map. You have access to all other areas, and can get to them faster than the other lanes. Because of this, you have to pay attention to your map, and the other lanes, to keep an eye on what is going on. The enemy Jungler will be passing through your lane a lot to get places, so always be careful. \r\n\r\nMid laners are generally going to be more mobile, higher damage, champs. \r\n\r\nPart of being a Midlaner is learning when to roam and go to other lanes. You won't want to be AFK in your lane, again, always be paying attention. Being mid comes with responsibility. Keeping wards in the bushes next to your lane is always a good idea, so that you can see when the enemy is coming. \r\n\r\nIf your Jungler needs help, you are generally going to be the person that can get there the fastest.\r\n\r\n\r\nBot Lane: ADC\r\nGood beginner champs: Jinx, Ashe, Sivir, Miss Fortune, Caitlyn. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing in the Botlane, this is the ADC (Attack Damage Carry), also called a Marksman. \r\n\r\nAs an ADC, you are wanting to farm, get gold, get items, and do lots of damage to the enemy. You will have a Support in lane with you. They help you do this by healing you, stunning enemies, and playing around and harassing the enemy so that you can do what you need to. It's a teamwork heavy lane.\r\n\r\nIn teamfights, you shouldn't be in the frontline, however you will be doing a LOT of damage to the enemies. When in your lane, the enemy Jungler will spend lots of time around there, as you are close to the objectives. When your Jungler is taking objectives, you will be there to help take those. \r\n\r\nYou want to Farm, and get gold, and get items, to get stronger. You are the damage. \r\n\r\nYou need to learn Wave Management, and how to control where your wave is. The Wave, being your minions that are coming to your lane. I won't go in depth. But you can learn how to freeze it, stall it, push it, etc.  \r\nBot Lane: Support\r\nGood beginner champs: Lulu, Nami, Thresh (a tad harder), Janna, Lux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen playing Support, your job is to, well, support your ADC. There are different types of Supports, just like other lanes, but generally there are Enchanters and Engage supports. \r\n\r\nEnchanter: Think shielding, buffing, throwing out spells, etc. \r\nEngage: Think hooks, getting up close, and letting your ADC follow up. \r\n\r\nThe warding section of this guide is important for you. As a Support, you need to be clearing enemy wards, placing your own wards, and setting up the area before a Dragon spawns so that you can see the enemy and know when they are there. \r\n\r\nIf you get a kill, great!  But that gold is much better used by your ADC, so your job is to support them, and make it easier for them to get gold, do damage, and kill.\r\n\r\nYou will Purchase the World Atlus, at the game start.

These have charges which you can see as the blue orbs floating around you. \r\nClasses: \r\n\r\nEach champion has a different Class that helps define them. Below are the classes present in LOL: \r\n\r\nArtillery - Mage \r\nAssassin - Slayer\r\nCatcher - Controller\r\nDiver - Fighter\r\nBattle - Mage\r\nBurst - Mage\r\nEnchanter - Controller\r\nJuggernaut - Fighter\r\nMarksman\r\nSkirmisher - Slayer\r\nSpecialist - Unclassified\r\nVanguard - Tank\r\nWarden - Tank\r\n\r\nArtillery: Artillery Mages are the masters of range, and they leverage that advantage to whittle down their opponents over time from great distances. In turn, Artillery Mages are severely punished when enemies finally succeed in closing in on them, due to their extreme fragility and limited mobility.\r\n\r\nAssassins: Assassins specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put them themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.\r\n\r\nCatcher: Catchers specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile and immobile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence\r\n\r\nDiver: Divers are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver\u2019s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.\r\n\r\nBattle: Battle Mages get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time.\r\n\r\nBurst: Burst Mages aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.\r\n\r\nEnchanter: Enchanters focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.\r\n\r\nSkirmishers: Skirmishers (also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.\r\n\r\nWardens: Wardens are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm\u2019s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray.\r\n\r\nJuggernauts: Juggernauts are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp. They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage, but in turn they have a tough time closing in on targets due to their low range and extremely limited mobility.", "start_char_idx": 20045, "end_char_idx": 24801, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e81bacf4-f131-4d60-a6a4-d57332287017": {"__data__": {"id_": "e81bacf4-f131-4d60-a6a4-d57332287017", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f033903a-8dd2-4ce1-b2ca-eae0884b5134", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfcb7c24b9bd43e56376cf9c72614e536c86d5434d2cd626e748b2ea17ac2fb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "527522a1-c8c8-4092-ba39-d878213d4da6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4017b760b47e14fbba65e18483dfb5e19c47c258e767bde757ce21c2b2084c47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a049e815-3925-40d4-aa4f-3046d7276b62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2428c4730b0024563bb60eeea10ac5fb41714490928198b569d932d1c71c02c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.\r\n\r\nWardens: Wardens are defensive tanks.

Vanguards lead the charge for their team and specialize at bringing the action. Their explosive team fight initiation seeks to catch enemies out of position while allowing allies to follow-up to devastating effect.\r\n\r\nLoot, Champions, Skin, Etc\r\n\r\nBelow, will be information about Skins, Blue Essence, Orange Essence, Mythic Essence, Shards, etc. \r\n\r\nWhen you level up, you will receive a Champion Capsule. Inside will be Blue Essence, and Champion Shards. Blue Essence is used only for purchasing champions in the Store. Eventually, you will have more than you know what to do with. Twice a year there is an Essence Emporium you can buy Chromas. \r\n\r\nChampion Shards are used to unlock Champions from your Loot page. If you have a champion shard, you can use that with BE to unlock a champion for cheaper, or you can disenchant it into more Blue Essence. Below you can see the Champion Shards. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also receive Hextech Chests, and Masterwork Chests, these require Keys to open. After a game people can honor you. If that happens enough, you receive Key Fragments (or you can purchase them in the store) Combine 3 of those and you get a Key. \r\n\r\nInside of those you can receive different things, a main one being Skin Shards. Skin Shards will be in your Loot, and they require Orange Essence to unlock. Once you unlock it, it is yours forever. The skin is of course, a Skin for that champion. You can also Reroll 3 of them, to get a mystery Skin that is unlocked right away and is yours forever. Or you can disenchant them for OE.\r\n\r\nEternals are optional, and are just stat trackers for certain champs. You can turn those into OE. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMythic Essence is used to purchase things from the Mythic Shop, which should show when you click on the ME in your Loot. It rotates every few patches with Skins that used to be available, but aren't anymore, and some new ones. These are generally going to be the Mythic level skins and Prestige Skins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChromas are different color variants of any skins you have. So if you have a skin you love, but don't like the color, you can equip a Chroma to change that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, you can always just buy RP from the Store and directly buy anything you want as well. \r\n\r\nYou can unlock Emotes that you can use during the game, and these are on a wheel accessed by holding T in game. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattle Pass: \r\nIf you want the BattlePass, you can purchase a ticket in the store, and then you play games to level it up.

If an inhibitor is destroyed, upgraded minions, called Super Minions, will spawn until an inhibitor respawns after a few minutes.Super minionsA team can often use the Super Minions to successfully siege a base that was previously difficult to attack and create an opportunity to push to victory.\r\n\r\nThe Fountain and Shop\r\nAt the beginning of each game, you\u2019ll begin at your fountain.

Auto-attacks, also known as \u201cbasic attacks\u201d occur when a player right clicks on a target. Doing so will cause a champion to continually attack a target until it dies.\r\n\r\nAbilities are cast using Q, W, E, and R. Every champion has abilities that are unique to them for each of these buttons. Here\u2019s Ashe\u2019s W, Volley, in action below:\r\n\r\nAshe's W, Volley\r\n\r\nAll champions also have access to two abilities, using D and F, called Summoner Spells. These are up to a player\u2019s personal preference, we\u2019ll discuss these later on.\r\n\r\nLastly, champions can also cast abilities from items such as Redemption and Tiamat, using the number keys, 1-7.\r\n\r\nChampion Stats\r\nA major aspect that sets champions apart is the distribution of their stats. Stats represent a champion\u2019s make up as far as how hard they are to kill, how much damage they do, and how fast they move or attack.\r\n\r\nLoL champion stats\r\nFrom left to right: attack damage, ability power, armor, magic resist, attack speed, ability haste, critical strike chance, movement speed.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose\u2019s of this beginner guide, we won\u2019t be getting too technical about stats. Here are the basics:\r\n\r\nHealth (indicated by a green bar)\r\nHealth represents the amount of damage you can take before dying and being sent to your fountain.\r\nAbility Resources: Mana, Energy, and others\r\nAbilities cost resources in order to cast them, most champions use mana, energy, or fury.\r\nThe majority of champions, such as Lux and Vel\u2019Koz, use mana.\r\nMana is indicated by a blue bar below the health bar and regenerates over time.\r\nChampions such as Akali and Kennen use energy.\r\nEnergy is indicated by a yellow bar and also regenerates over time but at a much faster rate. These champions often have ways to get energy back as well, such as by auto-attacking.\r\nThe tradeoff is that unlike mana, you cannot increase the amount of energy you have through buying items.\r\nOther champions use other sources, such as their health, fury, rage, or courage.\r\nUsing health is straightforward, your champion basically takes damage in order to cast their spell.\r\nFury, rage, and courage, are dependent on their champions. Be sure to check them out for more details.\r\nAttack Damage (AD)\r\nAttack damage, also known as physical damage, represents the damage dealt by basic auto-attacks.\r\nDepending on a champion, AD can also empower abilities.\r\nNumbers from abilities and items that refer to attack damage are displayed as orange.\r\nAbility Power (AP)\r\nAbility power primarily makes your abilities (QWER) more powerful, however, AP can also strengthen some items and runes.\r\nNumbers from abilities and items that refer to ability power are displayed as green.\r\nArmor\r\nArmor is a defensive stat that mitigates physical damage. Building it will help you survive against champions with a lot of attack damage.\r\nMagic Resist (MR)\r\nYou probably guessed it, but magic resist is the counterpart to armor that mitigates damage from ability power.\r\nAttack Speed (AS)\r\nAttack speed represents how fast your champion auto-attacks. In general, this is a good combination with attack damage if you\u2019re looking to increase your physical damage output.\r\nAbility Haste\r\nAbilities have \u201ccooldowns\u201d representing how long it will be before you can cast it again. Items that give you ability haste allow you to cast abilities more often.\r\nCritical Strike Chance\r\nThis stat represents your chance of landing a critical strike \u2013 critical strikes cause your auto-attacks to deal double its damage.\r\nFor example, if you have 50% crit chance, your attacks will likely crit 50% of the time. If you have 100% crit chance, they will crit every time.\r\nMovement Speed (MS)\r\nMovement speed represents how fast your champion moves around the map. This can be increased with abilities and items such as boots.\r\nExperience and Leveling up a Champion\r\nIn League of Legends, every champion starts at level 1 and continues to level up until the max of level 18.\r\n\r\nChampions gain experience by farming minions and jungle camps or killing (or assisting in killing) champions.\r\n\r\nNote that killing jungle camps or monsters will only provide experience for the player who landed the killing blow.\r\n\r\nDestroying turrets and inhibitors grants experience to a whole team globally.\r\n\r\nExperience range\r\nEven at this range, Aurelion Sol will get experience when the minion dies.\r\n\r\nYou can also gain experience by being within range of enemy minions or enemy champions dying.

This radius is about equal to around 3x a champion\u2019s auto-attack (exactly 1600 range).\r\n\r\nGaining levels and experiences allows champions to grow in power. While buying items allow champions to have freedom in choosing which stats to gain, gaining levels activates predetermined increases to a champion\u2019s stats.\r\n\r\nFor example, at level 1, Ashe will have around 539 base hp. At level 18, she\u2019ll have 1984. This growth applies to health, health regen, mana, mana regen, attack damage, attack speed, armor, and magic resist.\r\n\r\nLeveling up also grants skill points which are used to increase the power of a champion\u2019s QWER abilities.\r\n\r\nAshe Skill Level Up\r\n\r\nThe effect of skill points can be dependent on the champion and the ability itself. In the example above for Ashe\u2019s W, Volley, increasing from ability level 1 to 2 will yield an increase of damage from 20 to 35 and a reduction in CDR from 15 to 12.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nSummoner Spells\r\nBeyond their QWER abilities, every summoner also must choose two summoner spells for their champion. Summoner spells act as two additional abilities with their own purposes and cooldowns.\r\n\r\nall summoner spells\r\n\r\nThey offer flexibility in helping you adapt at champ select and allow you to play toward your preferred playstyle. When you first start playing, you\u2019ll gradually unlock them over time (check out the section at the bottom for more info). In this section, we\u2019ll be going over what each one does and why you\u2019d want to take it.\r\n\r\nHeal (240 second cooldown)\r\nHeal\r\n\r\nHeal instantly replenishes some of your health (based on your level) and increases your movement speed by 1%.\r\nIt also heals one other ally. You can choose which one it targets by hovering them when you cast Heal. If you don\u2019t specifically with your cursor it will automatically heal the ally closet to dying.\r\nThis is most commonly seen at a bot lane by the ADC role or sometimes, the Support role. This is because it heals two allies at once, giving it more value there than compared to other roles.\r\nGhost (180 second cooldown)\r\nGhost\r\n\r\nThis summoner spell grants a large amount of increased movement speed (based on level) for 10 seconds and allows you to run through units (champions, monsters, minions).\r\nGhost makes a great choice for champions that rely on chasing down their opponents or want to stay at a safe distance.\r\nIt\u2019s a lot less flexible than its counterpart, Flash, so you\u2019ll often see it paired with Flash rather than replacing it.\r\nBarrier (180 second cooldown)\r\nBarrier\r\n\r\nBarrier instantly grants you a shield (based on your level) that is great for mitigating burst damage.\r\nYou\u2019ll often see Barrier for the Mid lane role but it\u2019s also taken by ADCs and Supports.\r\nExhaust (210 second cooldown)\r\nExhaust\r\n\r\nExhaust slows a champion and reduces their damage output by 40% over 2.5 seconds.\r\nThis is primarily used defensively but can be used as a crowd control option for chasing opponents.\r\nFlash (300 second cooldown)\r\nFlash\r\n\r\nFlash is by far the most popular summoner spell. It allows you to blink a short distance in any direction.\r\nThis may sound very simple at first but the flexibility Flash offers let\u2019s it be equally viable in offensive and defensive situations.\r\nYou can use it to engage and surprise an enemy, or use it to escape over a wall or out of harm\u2019s way.\r\nTeleport (360 second cooldown)\r\nTeleport\r\n\r\nThis summoner spell allows you to instantly teleport to an allied ward, minion, or tower.\r\nBe aware that this takes 4-seconds to channel and it can be interrupted by a stun or other forms of crowd control.\r\nSmite (210 second cooldown)\r\nSmite\r\n\r\nSmite allows you to instantly cast a high burst damage spell upon a minion, monster, or pet (a minion controlled by a champion\u2019s abilities).\r\nThis is a jungler\u2019s core summoner spell and is required in order to play the role.\r\nSmiting objectives (see the objectives section) allows you to secure them more reliably to get the last-hit before your foes.", "start_char_idx": 3750, "end_char_idx": 8513, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1dbe1208-c74e-4d55-8189-fe4bc8c60d5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1dbe1208-c74e-4d55-8189-fe4bc8c60d5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0768a7dd-a3a9-4a3a-9b5d-1c8c757980c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4f094c5237355c13139c61b3087eb983544af1395b0dfec38631144d5c9e3c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f8d0175-9706-464b-8be0-e137bd6e0334", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f3e938d56f7c36af96f203aac5e0a41fd2a3bfa054faad89d281287518eb2c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "15106073-8706-4703-b449-87ca87aadab7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "05d6ee590990ed4690e6f40915a2182f4e11a575bf5c7e8b063bbc0b685aa381", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This may sound very simple at first but the flexibility Flash offers let\u2019s it be equally viable in offensive and defensive situations.\r\nYou can use it to engage and surprise an enemy, or use it to escape over a wall or out of harm\u2019s way.\r\nTeleport (360 second cooldown)\r\nTeleport\r\n\r\nThis summoner spell allows you to instantly teleport to an allied ward, minion, or tower.\r\nBe aware that this takes 4-seconds to channel and it can be interrupted by a stun or other forms of crowd control.\r\nSmite (210 second cooldown)\r\nSmite\r\n\r\nSmite allows you to instantly cast a high burst damage spell upon a minion, monster, or pet (a minion controlled by a champion\u2019s abilities).\r\nThis is a jungler\u2019s core summoner spell and is required in order to play the role.\r\nSmiting objectives (see the objectives section) allows you to secure them more reliably to get the last-hit before your foes.\r\nIt also helps clear jungle camps and offers increased damage or a slow based on the jungle item upgrade you purchase.\r\nCleanse (210 second cooldown)\r\nCleanse\r\n\r\nThis summoner spell is sort of like a get out of jail free card as it removes all disables (except for being airborne from knockouts or being suppressed).\r\nIt allows you to get out of an otherwise tight situation and also increases your tenacity, which means that it makes you temporarily resistant to additional incoming crowd control effects.\r\nIgnite (180 second cooldown)\r\nIgnite\r\n\r\nIgnite is a spell that lasts over 5 seconds and inflicts burning damage.\r\nIt can often help you secure a kill as an enemy is trying to escape if you\u2019re able to land it in time.\r\nIt also decreases the amount of healing a champion can receive so it\u2019s useful against champions with healing effects.\r\nThis also implies that it counters the Heal spell, just make sure to cast Ignite before the Heal goes off.\r\nRunes\r\nLeague of Legends is all about discovering the best way for you to play based on your personal preferences. On top of summoner spells, runes provide another way for you to tune your champion to either maximize their strengths or to help keep their weaknesses in check.\r\n\r\nRunes\r\n\r\nIn this section, we\u2019ll be covering the overarching themes of each of the five main rune trees and explaining how to equip rune pages.\r\n\r\nThe five rune trees are Precision, Domination, Sorcery, Resolve, and Inspiration.\r\n\r\nPrecision\r\nPrecision\r\n\r\nFocuses on empowering auto-attacks making it ideal for ranged carries like Ashe or a melee fighter like Tryndamere.\r\nExample: Press the Attack rewards you for continuously attacking the same target by increasing your overall damage output.\r\nDomination\r\nDomination\r\n\r\nImproves your ability to instantly burst or kill a target, it\u2019s no surprise that you\u2019ll often see assassins like Katarina or Talon take Domination.\r\nExample: Predator grants you a huge burst of movement speed to allow you to quickly chase down your prey.\r\nSorcery\r\nSorcery\r\n\r\nSorcery augments your abilities but also provides a good amount of utility. It\u2019s most commonly taken by mages and casters like Karma or Lux.\r\nExample: Summon Aery improves the punch of your spells and also increases the potency of supportive spells by shielding an ally you cast on.\r\nResolve\r\nResolve\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking to bolster your defensive capabilities, this is your rune. Beefy tanks and engagers like Nautilus and Leona love the Resolve tree.\r\nExample: Aftershock provides a burst of bonus armor and magic resist if you immobilize an enemy.\r\nInspiration\r\nInspiration\r\n\r\nInspiration is all about breaking the rules with wacky powers and capabilities. It can be used by many different champions but is very situational.\r\nExample: Unsealed Spellbook allows you to switch your summoner spells to other ones, rewarding your ability to adapt and think ahead.\r\nRune Page\r\n\r\nAt summoner level 10, you\u2019ll receive full access to customize your rune page. You can create a rune page in your client outside of game or during champ select. Either way, your created rune page will stay saved until you delete it for another one or change it.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a rune page there are three main components:\r\n\r\nPrimary tree\r\nSecondary tree\r\nShards\r\nNote that choosing runes can be tricky because you can only choose one rune per row, so make sure to keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nThe primary tree grants you access to a rune tree\u2019s most powerful choices, known as a keystone. In total, you\u2019ll get four rune choices from your primary tree so make sure they\u2019re in line with what your champion excels at.\r\n\r\nThe secondary tree only provides you with two choices, you\u2019ll want to use this to compliment your primary tree.\r\n\r\nLastly, you get three choices of shards. Shards provide a little bit of flexibility independent of the five trees. For example, you can choose between having additional raw damage, more attack speed, or shorter cooldowns.", "start_char_idx": 7634, "end_char_idx": 12469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15106073-8706-4703-b449-87ca87aadab7": {"__data__": {"id_": "15106073-8706-4703-b449-87ca87aadab7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0768a7dd-a3a9-4a3a-9b5d-1c8c757980c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4f094c5237355c13139c61b3087eb983544af1395b0dfec38631144d5c9e3c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1dbe1208-c74e-4d55-8189-fe4bc8c60d5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "126ab97a5f9674a4d0a3cf9e4e26c3cb9e9981d5c654d7654dfa0d4fe9d54122", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Either way, your created rune page will stay saved until you delete it for another one or change it.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a rune page there are three main components:\r\n\r\nPrimary tree\r\nSecondary tree\r\nShards\r\nNote that choosing runes can be tricky because you can only choose one rune per row, so make sure to keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nThe primary tree grants you access to a rune tree\u2019s most powerful choices, known as a keystone.

Be sure to try them all out and check out our champion pages where we curate and constantly update the best rune pages for every role.\r\n\r\n3. The Five LoL Roles\r\nIn a standard game of League of Legends, each of the five players on a team is assigned to one of the five specific roles. The five roles are Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, and Support.\r\n\r\nBefore a match, you have the opportunity to select a primary role which indicates the role you\u2019d prefer to play, as well as a secondary role which represents a backup choice.\r\n\r\nSince roles vary in popularity, keep in mind that you are not guaranteed to get either of your primary or secondary choices. You can also choose an option to \u201cFill\u201d which means that you don\u2019t mind playing any of the roles.\r\n\r\nPositional Roles\r\nFrom left to right: Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support, and at the bottom, Fill.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a brand new player, we suggest that you spend time playing a few games of each role to get a feel for where each one operates and what each one does. Eventually, you do want to settle on a \u201cmain\u201d role because it can really help you improve faster and learn to specialize a particular skill set.\r\n\r\nFor more reasons on why you should pick a main role and some guidelines for understanding the expectations of the five roles, check out our infographic below:\r\n\r\nHow to Choose Your Main Role in League of Legends (infographic)\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that these were just guidelines regarding the five roles. The champions that are played within each role and the expectations for each often change over time as players experiment and optimize.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Season 8, many champions that would be normally found in mid lane became temporarily commonplace at the ADC role (this is a story for another time).\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends role mapUse these guidelines to get a solid foundation for what each role in the game\u2019s current state (circa Season 9) to get you off your feet, but as you get better, don\u2019t be afraid to try things out in a Normal match.

What is a team comp?\r\nSince League of Legends is a 5 vs 5 team game, the combinations of champions that your team assembles at champ select can be incredibly important. Often times, you can greatly increase your chances of winning by synergizing the abilities and strengths of your choices.\r\n\r\nChamp select\r\n\r\nAn easy example to understand is an area-of-effect team (AoE) composition. This team combines five champions who have spells and abilities that can either deal damage to multiple champions or hold multiple champions in place with crowd control.\r\n\r\nEvery team comp tends to have a goal in mind, known as a win condition. The win condition of an AoE comp is to catch and kill multiple team members at once. If the AoE comp is able to do so, they will likely win a fight.\r\n\r\nAnother example of a team comp would be the skirmish comp. Skirmish team comps utilize champions that have high mobility and like to fight in messy fights from multiple angles.\r\n\r\nA skirmish team comp would likely beat an AoE team comp because an AoE team comp would struggle to lock down multiple skirmishers at once if they play their cards right.\r\n\r\nSince the AoE team comp relies on powerful spells that have long cooldowns, while skirmishers have attacks and abilities that are weaker but can be cast more often, the skirmish team comp can play around the abilities of the AoE team comp.\r\n\r\nIn the infographic below, we cover the strengths and weaknesses of the most common team compositions:\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends Team Comps\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re learning about the game as a new player, don\u2019t worry too much about creating the perfect team comp at champ select. You\u2019ll want to focus more on just playing your comfort champions and mastering them.\r\n\r\nWe just wanted to introduce you since it is something that will be mentioned often in game and in other places such as if you watch pro-play or streamers.\r\n\r\n5. Fog of War and Vision Control\r\nFog of War\r\n\r\nIn League of Legends, you must make decisions with incomplete information. This is because you cannot see everything that is happening on the map due to something called the \u201cfog of war\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fog of war is shown on the minimap as a darkened area, as shown to the left. It conceals enemy movement and you want to be careful not to wander through it unless you have company or if you have a good understanding of where your opponents are.\r\n\r\nLikewise, your team can use the fog of war to hide your movements and strike your enemies from the shadows.\r\n\r\nYou and all of your allied champions and structures provide vision for your whole team. If you can see it, so can your teammates.\r\n\r\nOutside of these sources of vision, you also have the ability to create more vision using items called \u201cwards\u201d.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the match, every player in the game has access to a free item, called the Warding Totem, which is also known as the \u201cyellow ward\u201d.\r\n\r\nUse the yellow ward to protect yourself by alerting your team of enemy movement. In the image below, the ward placed in the bush spots an enemy Vi that is moving around top lane.\r\n\r\nIf the ward was not there, you or your teammates who were near the top side of the map may have been blindsided and killed.\r\n\r\nThe vision control here allows your team the opportunity to retreat or set up a counter trap to kill the Vi.\r\n\r\nYellow Trinket\r\n\r\nThese wards will last a limited amount of time and will eventually expire, so be sure to keep an eye on its time remaining.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll know how much time is left on a ward by clicking on it or seeing the white bar (seen in the image above), which ticks down as time passed. If the time runs out, it\u2019ll disappear.\r\n\r\nTake note that the ward also has a green health bar comprised of three blocks. This is a good time to let you know that wards can be destroyed by the enemy team. Each block on the green bar represents an auto-attack hit, so it would take three hits to kill the Warding Totem.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of wards in League of Legends (we\u2019ll cover them in this article). This type of ward stays invisible unless it is revealed by the enemy team by a Control Ward or Red Trinket.\r\n\r\nControl Ward\r\n\r\nControl wards take four hits to be destroyed but are visible to everyone. Within a certain radius, control wards block the vision of enemy wards and reveal where they are.\r\n\r\nYou can strategically use control wards to deny enemy vision from an important area on the map or to clear a ward that you know had been placed.\r\n\r\nThe other major method of clearing wards is the Oracle Lens, also known as the red trinket. The red trinket allows a player to walk around and expose enemy wards around them (shown in the image below).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4692, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f96aa5c7-f283-43bf-b287-55ce325d5dbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f96aa5c7-f283-43bf-b287-55ce325d5dbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90baeb27-dd18-492b-aac0-68189ab2e031", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afa8694f025ed5c10a26da0c1f1d4489864bc14e0ab1ed98801e40ced2f2b45e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5152b8a7-627f-40ff-b801-5120b18f4977", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b733f7646bba07b0d6eef863b3d91a7ff6732bfbfed9dde1fba678d613ab439", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80c41fd9-d405-4228-a994-688da915b4a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b13b1ce45c1b0c1636866a055a7dc4591ad35d5dc1377c55927831c7ad98d7f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Each block on the green bar represents an auto-attack hit, so it would take three hits to kill the Warding Totem.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of wards in League of Legends (we\u2019ll cover them in this article).

The red trinket allows a player to walk around and expose enemy wards around them (shown in the image below).\r\n\r\nRed trinket\r\nClearing enemy wards throughout a match is incredibly important as it denies their ability to track your teams movements and also allows you to find gaps in their defenses to attack.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important that everyone contributes to this cause and it\u2019s normal for every team to eventually have 1-2 red trinkets dedicated to seeking and destroying enemy wards.\r\n\r\nThe last type of ward is the Farsight Alteration, also known as the blue trinket. Blue trinket allows a player to place a ward at a much further distance, and it will remain there until it is destroyed.\r\n\r\nBlue trinket\r\n\r\nThe downside is that it is visible to the enemy team and dies in one hit \u2013 because of this, this is the most situational ward and is mostly only used by the most vulnerable member of your team or a champion that relies on very long range attacks.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a common mistake for newer players to forget about fighting for vision control (even experienced players forget to prioritize it). Remember that the more information you have, the better decisions you\u2019ll make. Make a conscious effort to do your part in placing wards and denying your enemies of vision and eventually it\u2019ll be second nature.\r\n\r\n6. The River, Jungle, and Camps\r\nIn between the lanes, you may notice the river that runs across the map as well as large sections of forest areas.\r\n\r\nThese areas are crucial because a lot of action occurs here as players move about to fight and contest monster camps and objectives.\r\n\r\nUnlike minions which belong to a particular team, these monster camps are neutral and can be slain by any player.Jungle camps\r\n\r\nSome camps are weak enough for one champion to clear on their own. This gives your team an additional source of income outside of the constant stream of minions.\r\n\r\nSince these camps respawn over time, there\u2019s a role in League of Legends completely dedicated to collecting these camps and moving throughout the jungle (check out jungler in the role section).\r\n\r\nSeveral of these camps also provide additional utility and temporary upgrades called \u201cbuffs\u201d It\u2019s important for your team to secure these buffs to give you the edge over your opponents.\r\n\r\nBlue buff image\r\n\r\nFor example, killing the Blue Sentinel grants the Crest of Insight (also known as \u201cblue buff\u201d) which grants increased mana regeneration and ability haste (more on these champion stats later).\r\n\r\nSlaying the Red Brambleback gives Crest of Cinders (also known as \u201cred buff\u201d) which grants increased health regen and causes your auto-attacks to slow your enemy and deal additional damage.\r\n\r\nJungle Plants\r\nAs you travel around the map through the river and jungle, you\u2019ll notice interactive plants popping up. They don\u2019t provide gold, experience, or buffs, but if you use them correctly, they can often save your life or help you facilitate a good fight.\r\n\r\nThe Blast Cone\r\nThe red plant you see in the jungle is the blast cone. Blast cones cause any champion within its radius to fly and land at a set distance.\r\n\r\nIn the picture below, you can see Rammus next to a cone and a red circle outline on the other side of the wall to his right.\r\n\r\nBlast ConeIf Rammus or any other champion would auto-attack the blast cone, Rammus would trampoline and land on the red circled outline. Spells and abilities will not affect the blast cone.\r\n\r\nThe blast cone allows champions that could not otherwise jump over or through walls to do so, allowing for more efficient movement and creative angles for ambushing opponents.\r\n\r\nA well-timed blast cone jump can often give you enough distance to escape from a pack of enemies chasing you.\r\n\r\nHowever, do be careful of your auto-attack timing as you may accidentally blast yourself towards your pursuers or launch an ally into danger.\r\n\r\nScryer\u2019s Bloom\r\nScryer\u2019s Bloom grants you a short glimpse into darkness as it reveals enemy champions or enemy wards (items that grant vision).\r\n\r\nIn the image below, if Rammus auto-attacks Scryer\u2019s Bloom, it will create a cone of cleared vision in the direction that Rammus is facing.", "start_char_idx": 3832, "end_char_idx": 8732, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80c41fd9-d405-4228-a994-688da915b4a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "80c41fd9-d405-4228-a994-688da915b4a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90baeb27-dd18-492b-aac0-68189ab2e031", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afa8694f025ed5c10a26da0c1f1d4489864bc14e0ab1ed98801e40ced2f2b45e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f96aa5c7-f283-43bf-b287-55ce325d5dbc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91c5e949a350df22ed1be7c1f63aa8b76e603f06a0f3ae9ab0e4f53d5151c305", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "08da7a72-f9c9-409d-bc0b-f34acbeaf8d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6e2b55131bfd47ae4ccec40ab15cf3ce5b5544fb6fbf66eab58d65a7a2a97da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Blast ConeIf Rammus or any other champion would auto-attack the blast cone, Rammus would trampoline and land on the red circled outline.

These spawn along the river and grant health and mana if you pop the plant with an auto-attack and walk over its fruits.\r\n\r\nIn the picture below, Sona has auto-attacked the Honeyfruit and is replenishing her resources.\r\n\r\nThis grants an opportunity for her to return back to battle when she may have otherwise needed to return back to base.\r\n\r\nHoney FruitNow, it probably seems like a no-brainer to try to get Honeyfruits whenever they\u2019re available but you\u2019ll actually have to be careful when you do so.\r\n\r\nAs you walk over the fruits, each one will actually slow down your movespeed. If you\u2019re being chased, you may want to consider skipping the fruit to maximize your chances of survival.\r\n\r\nThis also means that if a foe you\u2019re hunting down runs close enough by the plant, you may be able to slow them down by hitting the Honeyfruit.\r\n\r\nThe Scuttle Crab\r\nAlong the rivers, you\u2019ll see a neutral monster, called the Scuttle Crab that walks back and forth near the Dragon pit and Baron pit. Slaying the crab will grant vision in the river near the openings of each respective pit.Scuttle Crab\r\n\r\nThe Scuttle Crab is incredibly easy to kill because it doesn\u2019t fight back but it can be hard to consistently take because it will be highly prioritized due to the free vision it provides. If you\u2019re a jungler, be sure to prioritize this camp as a stop as you travel the map, and if you\u2019re another role, be ready to help your jungler if the enemy team is looking to stop them.\r\n\r\nElemental Dragons\r\nAll League of Legends dragons spawn at the bot side dragon pit. The 6 elemental dragons, also known as elemental drakes, grant team-wide buffs to ALL players on the side that kills them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are their names and their effect:\r\n\r\nCloud Drake = increased movement speed when you aren\u2019t fighting\r\nInfernal Drake= grants ability power and attack damage\r\nMountain Drake = increases damage against objectives (turrets, Dragon, Baron)\r\nOcean Drake= grants missing health and mana regen when you aren\u2019t fighting\r\nHextech Drake= empowers auto-attacks\r\nChemtech Drake= extra attack speed\r\nDragon\r\n\r\nThe drakes spawn at random and you can get the same element multiple times. Each effect stacks up to three times and becomes more powerful. For example, slaying one Cloud Drake will grant your team +15 bonus movement speed out of combat \u2013 if you\u2019re able to get three, you\u2019ll have a total of +45 bonus movement speed.\r\n\r\nGetting an elemental dragon won\u2019t help you win instantly but can make the game easier for you and your teammates overtime. They\u2019re quite powerful in the early to mid game so they will often require multiple team members to slay, especially if the other team is looking to contest it.\r\n\r\nThe Elder Dragon\r\nThe Elder Dragon, also known as Elder Drake, spawns in the late game and is the most powerful dragon in the game. Slaying an Elder Drake grants a buff that multiplies the effects of all the elemental dragon buffs that your team currently has by 50%.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re able to kill two Elder Dragons, all of your elemental buffs will be multiplied by 100%. It also grants additional damage to non-turret targets (such as champions and monsters).\r\n\r\nAspect of the Dragon\r\n\r\nThis makes Elder Dragon one of the best late game monsters to help your team secure a victory in a close match, especially if you were successful in taking elemental dragons earlier in the game.\r\n\r\nRift Herald\r\nThe Rift Herald is a monster that resides in the Baron pit before Baron is slain or spawns near 20 minutes.", "start_char_idx": 7817, "end_char_idx": 12550, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08da7a72-f9c9-409d-bc0b-f34acbeaf8d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "08da7a72-f9c9-409d-bc0b-f34acbeaf8d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90baeb27-dd18-492b-aac0-68189ab2e031", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afa8694f025ed5c10a26da0c1f1d4489864bc14e0ab1ed98801e40ced2f2b45e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "80c41fd9-d405-4228-a994-688da915b4a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b13b1ce45c1b0c1636866a055a7dc4591ad35d5dc1377c55927831c7ad98d7f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Elder Dragon\r\nThe Elder Dragon, also known as Elder Drake, spawns in the late game and is the most powerful dragon in the game.

A crucial tip to remember is that it has a weak spot on it\u2019s back that will inflict additional damage if you hit it.\r\n\r\nRift HeraldAfter a team kills the Herald, a purple item, called Eye of the Herald, will drop that one allied team member can pick up (it cannot be touched by the team that did not kill it). When picked up, the item will replace the player\u2019s trinket slot and will remain there until it is used.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Eye of the Herald is one of the most devastating in the game, so it\u2019s not surprising that it only has one use. Activating the Eye will summon the Herald to fight for your team by attacking enemy structures until it dies. Here it is below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the Rift Herald inflicts a massive amount of damage. It can often help you take the first turret in the game which can help swing an even game into your favor.\r\n\r\nOne last tip is that activating the Eye requires a short amount of channeling time \u2013 if the player using it is interrupted by a hard crowd control effect such as a stun, silence, or knockup., they will fail to summon the Rift.\r\n\r\nSo if you\u2019re using it, be sure to do so safely away from combat. If you know the other team is looking to use it, try to keep vision on them and look to CC them while they\u2019re channeling.\r\n\r\nBaron Nashor\r\nThe last monster you\u2019ll need to know about is the Baron Nashor, also known as just \u201cBaron\u201d. Baron is the most powerful monster in Summoner\u2019s Rift so you\u2019ll need multiple team members to slay it unless a match goes on for a very long time (eventually few or even one champion may be able to slay it on their own).\r\n\r\nBaron Nashor\r\n\r\nSince Baron is so strong, teams can often win by killing a team that\u2019s low on health because they tried to take it at a bad time. It can often be the site of a \u201cfinal battle\u201d at the end of a close game as the winning team can use it to get a big enough lead to secure a victory.\r\n\r\nSo what does slaying Baron do exactly? It grants a buff, called Hand of Baron, that is given to all living members of the team that slayed the Baron. This means that if you died while fighting Baron or for Baron, you will not receive the buff if you are still dead when the final blow is made.\r\n\r\nHand of Baron\r\n\r\nHand of Baron temporarily grants AD and AP and strengthens minions that you are close to. This makes it much easier to push toward the enemy Nexus since it\u2019s harder for the enemy team to kill the empowered minions and easier for your team to defend them.\r\n\r\nIf you do not outright win by pushing with Baron minions, the enemy base will likely be destroyed enough to make your future attempts much easier. So don\u2019t be too greedy and overextend. If you can only get a few turrets and inhibitors, that\u2019s still a good gain.", "start_char_idx": 11747, "end_char_idx": 15379, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fdc27bf-7133-4542-8865-905fed396168": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fdc27bf-7133-4542-8865-905fed396168", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c21f6ac4-de69-4e8c-bfd0-74b6839a4821", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62ed7c5227203a0924f67cae8080d527c13389dd7a1fb3d591d4bbf3a8d9040a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f99091b-c0ad-4751-8011-0756cbfee8c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9bf167d7fb6d90804e820cef78267ccba10002b4d9625108a81cc4ea86594e04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Mobalytics, Guide 7-end, 7. The Three Phases and Scaling\r\nThese concepts are leaning more towards being intermediate than beginner, but we want to quickly go over them since you\u2019ll likely hear the terminology of the three phases: early game, mid game, and late game.\r\n\r\nThe phases aren\u2019t set in stone and act more as guidelines as every game is different in its own way, but they tend to hold true to regarding how the majority of games turn out:\r\n\r\nEarly game (the first 15 minutes)\r\n\r\nThis is when all the turrets are up and everyone is in their lane except for the junglers.\r\nUntil the jungler arrives, top and mid will mostly be 1v1 and bot lane will mostly be 2v2.\r\nMid game (15 to 30 minutes)\r\n\r\nAt around 15 minutes, or when the first turrets begin to be destroyed, the mid game begins.\r\nDuring the mid game, a match becomes messier than lane phase as some players will remain in lane while others will begin to roam around the map to help destroy other turrets or contest dragons or Rift Herald.\r\nLate game (after 30 minutes)\r\n\r\nThe mid game usually ends and around the 30 minute mark when all of the first turrets in the lanes are destroyed (sometimes even more are gone by then). This is the late game.\r\nAt this point, champions have acquired many of their major items and teams begin to group for large teamfights around Baron and Elder Dragons.\r\nSo why are the three phases important? In League of Legends, every champion is designed to be good during a certain time period. Some champions are designed to be strong in the early game but fall off the longer the game goes while others are designed to be weak early but get continuously stronger as the game goes on.\r\n\r\nWhen a champion is at their strongest, it is known as a \u201cpower spike\u201d. The process of getting gradually stronger and achieving your power spike is known as \u201cscaling\u201d. We won\u2019t get too into detail here but know that scaling is usually influenced by a champion\u2019s ability kit and their stat ratios as they buy more items. Let\u2019s cover a few examples.\r\n\r\nBlitzcrank: Early game power spike\r\nBlitzcrank power spike\r\nBlitzcrank is one of the scariest early game supports because of his signature move, Rocket Grab, which pulls an enemy toward him. One well-timed grab can pull a vulnerable target and turn a 2v2 into a very quick 1v2 death.\r\n\r\nHis whole kit revolves around making picks and gaining an early advantage for his team. As the game goes on, however, Blitzcrank\u2019s grab loses power because it becomes harder for him to grab his ideal target.\r\n\r\nInstead of worrying about weaving his grab through a minion wave, he has to worry about getting it through a frontline of tanks during teamfights. His ability is also outclassed by better engage options that can target multiple champions instead of just one.\r\n\r\nAhri: Mid game power spike\r\nAhri power spike\r\nThe mid game is all about quick rotations with messy skirmishers and unpredictable team fights. Ahri hits her power spike during this time because she is a mage that utilizes a high amount of mobility and lower cooldown abilities that can be cast often.\r\n\r\nMid game fights are often fought from different angles and uneven numbers (3v2\u2019s, 2v4\u2019s, etc) so being mobile and flexible has more value. She can use hit and run tactics and move around the map quickly to help her laners that are still trying to take their turret or her jungler who is contesting objectives.\r\n\r\nShe isn\u2019t necessarily bad in the early game but will be outdamaged by champions that have less mobility and more punch, and she tends to fall off in the late game since she doesn\u2019t have strong late game scaling compared to other champions.\r\n\r\nKog\u2019Maw: Late game power spike\r\nKog'Maw power spike\r\n\r\nWhen the late game arrives, you\u2019ll start to see large scale teamfights with high stakes. One false move can mean all five of your allies dying and a charge by the enemy team to destroy your base.\r\n\r\nKog\u2019Maw is a champion who\u2019s easy to kill when alone but able to deal an insane amount of damage when he\u2019s protected (some team comps are even built around him). In the organized situations during the late game where you have multiple frontliners and a backline of damage dealers, Kog\u2019Maw is at his best.\r\n\r\nHe hits his spike during the late game because he also has access to most or all of his items. During the early game he\u2019s focused on farming and won\u2019t do that much damage and in the mid game, he\u2019s vulnerable during skirmishes since they often happen from multiple angles.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f99091b-c0ad-4751-8011-0756cbfee8c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f99091b-c0ad-4751-8011-0756cbfee8c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c21f6ac4-de69-4e8c-bfd0-74b6839a4821", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62ed7c5227203a0924f67cae8080d527c13389dd7a1fb3d591d4bbf3a8d9040a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fdc27bf-7133-4542-8865-905fed396168", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b78d0a798e45fa80246dc1008fdd276dc2e30c93e26a4b7f445789704319632a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9ab32ff-60ec-4c60-b0cc-c7a924d00155", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f03d47c739d4a8a6593d4002f5bad7c86af10fc80284474704ebc25905903dd8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Kog\u2019Maw: Late game power spike\r\nKog'Maw power spike\r\n\r\nWhen the late game arrives, you\u2019ll start to see large scale teamfights with high stakes.
