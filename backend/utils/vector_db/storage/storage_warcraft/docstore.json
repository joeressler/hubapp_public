At the upper right corner of your screen you will see My Account. Clicking this gives you several options, including options to Log In or Create a Free Account. This allows you to create a Battle.net account. Your Battle.net account is shared with all other Blizzard games including Diablo, Overwatch, Starcraft, and Hearthstone. If you already own one of those games, you can use your existing Battle.net account to play World of Warcraft as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a free account if you don't have one. You will be prompted to create a BattleTag. Your BattleTag works as your account-wide nickname, not to be confused with your World of Warcraft characters' nicknames. This nickname will be your cross-game identity for your account. People on your Friends List will see your BattleTag, not your real name. You can only change your BattleTag once for free. Any additional changes will require payment, so keep that in mind and choose wisely.\r\nHow to Download and Install World of Warcraft\r\nOnce you are logged in, click under your username in the upper right corner of your screen and go into Account Settings.\r\nClick on Download Games\r\nFind World of Warcraft on the Games list\r\nSelect your Platform - currently World of Warcraft supports both Windows and Mac\r\nClick on the Platform Download link\r\nClick on the Download button\r\nOnce the download has finished, open the downloaded file and it will prompt you to log in with your Battle.net Account\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the Battle.net App, a portal for managing all of your Blizzard games. Your World of Warcraft installation should begin automatically. Note that World of Warcraft is huge, you are downloading and installing a whole universe into your machine. These things take time - but it's worth the wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow to Purchase World of Warcraft\r\nWorld of Warcraft is free to play up to level 20 so that new players can experience the game without first having to buy it.\r\n\r\nOnce you reach level 20, or before if you are enjoying yourself and want full access, you will need to purchase Game Time. This will allow you access to all content up to Level 50.\r\nMonthly Increments: The easiest way to purchase World of Warcraft game time is to sign up for a recurring subscription: World of Warcraft\u00ae: Subscription. You can pay monthly or in 3 or 6-month blocks for a discount.\r\nDaily Increments: You can also buy game time cards. These are available from the Blizzard shop: Game Time. They can also be found at retailers like Amazon.\r\nPaying With Gold: You can also buy game time with the gold that you earn in game. Visit the Auction House and select WoW Token. The price fluctuates quite a bit, so you may have to keep a careful eye on it to figure out your best deal.\r\nIn order to unlock all of the features of the game, including the latest end-game content, you will need to purchase Dragonflight, the latest expansion of the game: World of Warcraft\u00ae: Dragonflight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information about Game Time and Subscribing to World of Warcraft check out these guides:\r\n\r\nWorld of Warcraft Game Time What is Battle.net Balance?\r\nWhat Now?\r\nYou have:\r\nMade a Battle.net Account\r\nDownloaded World of Warcraft setup\r\nAccessed the installation through the Battle.net App\r\nInstalled the game\r\nGot free access through level 20\r\nEstablished your payment options\r\nUpgraded to Dragonflight\r\nNow log in and have fun!", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4120, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14767279-bdc6-4398-896f-0bfca1c9dcb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "14767279-bdc6-4398-896f-0bfca1c9dcb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74ee7439-9aec-4508-81a7-196ca7a9a23f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "318fd44cfa1f5a25c06c792fe84f988fe0150f1e1e41ee37f93e022a0ad705e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30cebbcd-a8d7-488c-a674-acc1000aa981", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef273121c6cee9f1a9a85388bfafc3deefe956e4f44aa104bfee6546ebd7b2a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Wowhead Beginner Guides, How to Create a Character, \r\nGetting Started\r\nSince this is your first time playing, you will start on the Character Creation screen. You can dive right in and create a character...but let's back up a bit and talk about some game systems first.\r\nChoosing a Realm\r\nNote: If you are on your own and don't have friends who play, you can skip this section. You might want to skim through it so you know what the deal is, but there is likely no reason for you to need to switch Realms.\r\n\r\nWorld of Warcraft has a concept called Realms for dividing players into population groups. The idea is that if everyone who played WoW was all in the game at once, it would be super crowded, very laggy, and generally difficult to play and have a good time. To solve this issue, Blizzard set up multiple servers so that each person can play the game in an environment where there are other players, but not too many other players. Each Realm is a different server and the players on each Realm can see, interact, and play with each other. If you want to play with someone on a different Realm, you can, but we'll get to that in a minute.\r\n\r\nWhen you Play for the first time, the game automatically picks a Realm for you, and starts you on the Character Creation screen. If you prefer to pick your Realm you can do that by clicking the Back button. At the top right of this new screen you can see which Realm you are on. The Change Realm button is directly below the Realm name. Click that and you can see a list of all available realms in your region. Notice that there are different Realm tabs at the bottom of the window; if you are looking for a particular Realm it might be under a different tab.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNotice that there are different types of Realms: Normal, and RP.\r\nNormal: A normal realm without any special rules.\r\nRP: RP stands for Role-playing, those realms are tailored for people interested in role-playing with their characters.\r\nWhy might you want to change your Realm? There are two main reasons.\r\nIf you want to play with a friend.\r\nIf you are primarily interested in Role Playing.\r\nIf neither applies to you, don't even worry about it! Move on to Character Creation...\r\n\r\nOnce you find or decide on a Realm, select it on the list and click Okay to connect to it.\r\n\r\nPlaying With Friends\r\nIf you are starting your adventure with someone else, you should both select the same Realm for the best experience. This way you will be able to see and interact with each other by default.\r\n\r\nIf you know someone who already plays the game and you would like to play with them, ask them which Realm they are on and make sure that you join that Realm too. Also ask which Faction they play - more on that in a minute.\r\nCreating a Character\r\nNow it is time to create your character! There are three primary choices that you need to make: Faction, Race, and Class. These are important because they dictate how you will interact with the game and with other players. Faction and Race can be changed for a price, but Class is a permanent decision. The only way to change Class is to create a new character.\r\nFaction\r\nThis is World of Warcraft and that means that there needs to be a war. For players, there are two factions in this conflict: The Horde, and The Alliance.\r\n\r\nPicking your faction is a major choice because players playing in separate factions cannot interact with one another in a peaceful way. This includes both chat and other social activities, including forming groups to complete objectives. If you want to play with friends, make sure you join the faction that they are affiliated with.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance and the Horde each have different backgrounds and stories, and are divided along racial lines. Which faction you choose will dictate where you play, who you play with, and what Races you can play.\r\n\r\nWhen World of Warcraft first started, The Alliance was what one could describe in RPG terms as the Normal Races, while the Horde was the Monstrous Races. As time has passed, that line has become fuzzier but still serves to give a general idea of what the divisions are.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance\r\nThe Alliance is the Blue Team. They are under the leadership of a king who lives in the City of Stormwind in the zone of Elwynn, on the continent of the Eastern Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe Horde\r\nThe Horde is the Red Team.

They are governed by a council from the capital of Orgrimmar in the Durotar zone, on the continent of Kalimdor.\r\nRace\r\nWithin each faction, you can pick from seven different races, Alliance players can be Humans, Dwarves, Night Elves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgens or Pandarens, while Horde players can be Orcs, Undead, Tauren, Trolls, Blood Elves, Goblins or Pandaren. Each race can only be certain classes, so picking a race will limit which class your character can be.\r\n\r\nThere are other playable races in the game, but they are unlocked through gameplay and you won't have access to them immediately.\r\nClass\r\nThere are twelve different classes in World of Warcraft, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. As a new player you can select any class but Demon Hunter or Death Knight, which both require that you already have a level 10 character before you can play one. You can learn more about each class by hovering over its icon on the character creation screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more details on each class, what they do, and why they may be the class for you, check out our comprehensive guide on the topic: Choosing Your Class: A Beginner's Guide.\r\n\r\nFor in depth instruction on how to play each class, check out out beginner guides:\r\n\r\nClass Leveling Guides\r\nDeath Knight\tDemon Hunter\tDruid\tHunter\r\nMage\tMonk\tPaladin\tPriest\r\nRogue\tShaman\tWarlock\tWarrior\r\n\r\nThe Character Creation Interface\r\nThe Character Creation Interface is very straightforward.\r\nAlliance races are listed on the left.\r\nHorde races are listed on the right.\r\nYou can switch gender using the buttons in the middle at the top. The gender of your character doesn't have any influence on what it can or cannot do in the game, it is purely cosmetic. Pick whichever model appeals to your character fantasy the most!\r\nAt the bottom of the screen you can see the classes available for you to play for the race that you have selected.\r\n\r\n\r\nPick a race, a class, and a gender. When you are ready, click the Customize button.\r\nCustomization\r\nThere are hundreds of different character customizations to choose from, depending on which race you selected. You can change hair color, fur color, skin color, markings, eye color, accessories, and more.\r\n\r\nClick the icons above the selection pickers to see more options. Some races have a lot more options than others.\r\n\r\n     \r\nCharacter Name\r\nOn this screen, you must also select your character's name. This name must be unique on the Realm you're playing on, plus there are a few names that cannot be used due to some restrictions. World of Warcraft is an established game with a lot of players so sometimes getting the name you want can be challenging. If your name is taken, don't be discouraged. Try alternative spellings, or make up a name. If you are feeling out of ideas, try the Randomize button, sometimes it can be just what you need to spark a good name idea!\r\n\r\nOnce you're done, hit Finish and your character will be ready to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Now?\r\nYou have:\r\nLearned how to change Realms\r\nLearned what you need to do if you want to play with friends\r\nChosen your class, race, and Faction\r\nCustomized your character\r\nChosen a unique character name\r\nCreated your first character\r\nWhen you're ready, hit Enter World.", "start_char_idx": 3623, "end_char_idx": 7569, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24554a2c-1a2f-46e6-9abe-94659ebfbe99": {"__data__": {"id_": "24554a2c-1a2f-46e6-9abe-94659ebfbe99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "523ad21b-0d23-4ee8-a5e4-06a5c52f0f2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27cbb9ecad0c6d1d07b11687f66b71078caf6d1330a3ecafd08c4ca89e6a7c07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "27dd9dde-7c70-4518-8323-793a099008f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "542f2e21405059448c8126cf8a44704a6f8bd82afbf28d331f16e077945ff31f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Wowhead Beginner Guides, How to Play World of Warcraft, Getting Started\nWhen you click Enter World for the first time on a character, you will be treated to a cut-scene, a short movie with a voice-over establishing your place in Azeroth as a member of whatever Faction you chose. The cut-scene will bring the camera to your character and then end with you standing on the deck of a ship.\n\n \n\n\nWelcome to the Exile's Reach scenario. This is a short scenario to introduce you to the game mechanics. The Exile's reach scenario does a pretty good job of showing you the basics as you go, and while this guide covers a lot of the same things, we have a little more detail.\n\nFirst, some basics.\nThe Camera\nThe camera is your view of the world, what you can see. In World of Warcraft, the camera is always centered on your character. You can manipulate the Camera in a few useful ways.\nYou can zoom in or zoom out by using your mouse scroll wheel.\nYou can look around by holding the Left Mouse Button and moving the Mouse. This will not move your character.\nYou can change your facing by holding the Right Mouse Button and moving the Mouse around the screen. This will also make your character face that direction.\n \n\nThe Action Bar\nAt the bottom of your screen you will notice a bar flanked by two gryphons. This is your Action Bar. Each square cell will hold a button allowing you to use your Abilities. As you can see in the image below, there are two Abilities currently on the Action Bar. In the top right corner of the occupied cells there is a digit. This digit corresponds to the number bar on your keyboard. To use the Ability, you can either click the button with your mouse, or press the corresponding number key. Empty cells do nothing if you click on them.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1762, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27dd9dde-7c70-4518-8323-793a099008f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "27dd9dde-7c70-4518-8323-793a099008f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "523ad21b-0d23-4ee8-a5e4-06a5c52f0f2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27cbb9ecad0c6d1d07b11687f66b71078caf6d1330a3ecafd08c4ca89e6a7c07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24554a2c-1a2f-46e6-9abe-94659ebfbe99", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee5e64a5f9ce57355b88786953e4ed45793b8561401a393014d0a9362556da08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ab49cb4-1a1a-4897-ad94-f2e28de41eb8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15d1b820bd088ec1579ec75cdacb43a8e07e3d695826cc958c004bf20cbefbcc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There are multiple rows of cells to put buttons in. At first you won't need them all, but the arrows at the right end of the Action Bar allow you to cycle through your Action Bars. If you know you had Abilities on your bar but you don't see them, you may have inadvertently switched Bars. Click the arrows to get back to Action Bar 1.\nMoving your Character\nTo move your character, there are two options: using your keyboard or using your mouse.\n\nUsing your keyboard, press W to move forward, S to move backwards, A to turn left, or D to turn right. You can also use the arrow keys to make these same movements.\n\nTo jump, use your space bar and strafe (move to the left or right while still facing forwards) using Q and E.\n\nWith your Mouse, you can hold both Left and Right Mouse Buttons down to move your character forward. Moving your mouse left or right will allow you to turn. You can't move backwards with your mouse, but you can turn around move a few steps, and turn back around very quickly, which usually serves the same purpose.\nOther Characters\nYou are going to see other characters. Some, like the Quest Giver in front of you are NPCs (Non-Player Characters), characters that aren't controlled by a player but who are part of the world. Others are Players, people like you, playing the game. Usually NPCs have their name in green over their head, while Player names are blue. NPCs tend to stand in place or have a small area that they may walk around. Players tend to be sitting or standing AFK (Away From Keyboard) or running about all over the place. You will get used to figuring out who is which.\nQuest Givers\nQuests are missions and the main source of experience in World of Warcraft. You will complete plenty of them while playing.\n\nQuest Givers are a type of NPC with which you will become intimately familiar. As the name implies, they give out quests. A Quest Giver has a yellow exclamation point over their head if they have a quest to offer you, or a yellow question mark if you have completed their quest and they are ready to give you your reward. A gray question mark indicates that you have accepted a quest from the Quest Giver, but have not yet completed the requirements to turn it in.\n\nIn the Exiles Reach screenshots above, Captain Garrick and Warlord Breka Grimaxe are the Quest Givers who have a quest for you. To interact with a Quest Giver, move to them, mouse over them, and right-click.\nLeveling and Experience\nAll characters have Levels. You start at Level 1. As you complete objectives you will earn Experience. As you earn Experience, you will gain Levels. The maximum Level is Level 60. Your Level defines how strong you are, what content you can enjoy, and how that content reacts to you, as well as how many Abilities, how much Health, and how many Resources you have to take on the content. More Levels = more power, more power = harder content. Once you reach Level 60 you will be ready to take on Endgame content which is some of the most fun, interesting, and rewarding content in the game, as well as the most challenging.\n\nIn order to reach the next Level, or to Level Up, you need to fill your Experience Bar. The Experience Bar is just below your Action Bar at the bottom of your screen. Every time you kill an enemy or complete a quest, you gain Experience which fills, even if a just little, that bar. Once the bar fills up completely, your Level is increased by one. You will get more Health, more of whatever Resource your Class uses, and often, a new Ability which you can add to your Action Bar and work into how you play your character. Note that some Abilities are Passive, meaning they grant you a bonus automatically and you don't need to have them on your Action Bar.\n\n\n\nFor more information about Experience and how to maximize it, check out our detailed guide: Rested Experience\n\nGameplay\nEnough information overload! You are here to play the game. So let's play!\nQuests\nCheck out the Quest Giver, the character in front of you with the yellow exclamation point over their head. Move to them, mouse over them, and right-click. This opens a window in the left side of your screen explaining your quest objectives. You can accept the quest by clicking Accept.\n\n\n\nAfter you have accepted the quest, the window will close and a gray question mark will appear over the head of the Quest Giver. You will also notice that the quest title appears on the right side of your screen along with the objectives. If you need a refresher, you can reread the quest by clicking on its title. This will open the quest window as well as your Map. While you are on the ship, your Map isn't very useful, but it will come in handy later.", "start_char_idx": 1766, "end_char_idx": 6445, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ab49cb4-1a1a-4897-ad94-f2e28de41eb8": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ab49cb4-1a1a-4897-ad94-f2e28de41eb8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "523ad21b-0d23-4ee8-a5e4-06a5c52f0f2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27cbb9ecad0c6d1d07b11687f66b71078caf6d1330a3ecafd08c4ca89e6a7c07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "27dd9dde-7c70-4518-8323-793a099008f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "542f2e21405059448c8126cf8a44704a6f8bd82afbf28d331f16e077945ff31f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68e332d8-c7d9-4554-b099-35e950249b11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "758835b7eeeb8592a7f5879899f0e8d027d94d0eb484573529589f4dbb3555ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "After you have accepted the quest, the window will close and a gray question mark will appear over the head of the Quest Giver.

This will open the quest window as well as your Map. While you are on the ship, your Map isn't very useful, but it will come in handy later.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many different types of quest objectives, but usually quests will require you to go somewhere and do something. If you are having trouble figuring out where to go, you can open your Map, by clicking on your quest, or by pressing M. The the quest objective is in the area highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\nCombat\nThere are two main subgroups of classes in the game: Ranged and Melee. Ranged classes can attack their enemies from a distance, while melee need to get close to their targets. So if you have selected a melee class, you must also get close to your target in order to attack it.\n\nIn the Exile's Reach scenario your first quest will ask you to practice on a Combat Dummy. Just move over to the Combat Dummy if you are a melee class (short range) or \"in range\" if you are a ranged class (long range). You will know that you are close enough if you click on the Combat Dummy and then look at your Action Bar. If the digits on your buttons are red, move a little closer. When they turn white, you are in range.\n\n  \n\n\nYou will have a few more training quests to complete while you are on the ship. Once you are off the ship (no spoilers!) things get fun!\n\nEarly quests will require you to kill enemies or creatures nearby. You will see their names and bars in yellow or red. That means that they are attackable targets, like the Combat Dummy. Red named enemies or \"mobs\" will attack you if you get to close to them. Yellow named mobs will allow you to strike first. The bar is their health bar; bringing their health to 0 will kill them.\n\nOnce you find your target, Left-Click on them or their name or bar to select them, that's called targeting. In the top left corner of your screen, you will see your character portrait, plus health bar and, if you have selected a target, the portrait of your target and their health bar. After targeting your objective, it is time to kill it.\n\n \n\nCheck out your Action Bar. At the start, you should have only one ability on it, which will be a damaging ability. In order to use it, press 1 while with a target selected. Some abilities have something called a cast time, meaning they take a few moments until they are launched and you cannot move while the cast is happening, while others happen instantaneously. When the ability is used with success, it will damage your enemy, which will make it attack you back. Repeat using your ability by pressing 1 whenever possible.\n\nOnce your enemy's health reaches 0, it will die. When an enemy dies, you can loot its corpse by getting near it and Right-Clicking it. It will twinkle helpfully to let you know it can be looted. When you loot a corpse, a loot window opens showing you what your victim was carrying. You can Right-Click an item to transfer it to your inventory.\nCompleting Quests\n\nOnce you've finished killing all enemies for your quest, it is time to turn it back to the quest giver.

Some quests will require you to loot corpses of enemies to search for some item. When that is the case, make sure to loot every enemy marked for the quest, because otherwise the objectives won't be completed.\n\nOther quests may have their objectives to be actual items in the world.

The purpose of this guide is to assist YOU, my fellow heroes and adventurers, in finding the class in World of Warcraft that YOU will enjoy playing. However, before we get started with finding your class, there are some disclaimers that I would like to make:\nSince this is a guide designed to help YOU decide what class will be best for YOU to play, I will do my best to ensure that this guide stays free of bias and only provide the information as it is.\nThis guide serves purely as a starting point for new or returning players. Advanced game play topics such as min/maxing, rotation, talents, and builds will NOT be covered by this guide.\nWorld of Warcraft is a game that is constantly evolving. I will do my best to update this guide on a regular basis to keep the information as current as possible.\nWith that information in mind, let's begin!\n\nGetting Started\nBefore we get started discussing classes in extensive detail, I would like to first go over some basic terminology:\n\nClass:\nWhen you are in the process of creating a new character, one of the first things you will notice (aside from gender, race, and faction selection) is that there are what's called \"Classes\". In World of Warcraft, there are a total of 12 classes to choose from and they are as follows: Death Knight Death Knight, Demon Hunter Demon Hunter, Druid Druid, Hunter Hunter, Mage Mage, Monk Monk, Paladin Paladin, Priest Priest, Rogue Rogue, Shaman Shaman, Warlock Warlock, and Warrior Warrior. Each class provides its own set of unique benefits, abilities, and spells (as you will discover from reading this guide).\nSpecialization:\nUpon reaching level 10, you will be able to select what is called your specialization or spec. Each class in World of Warcraft has its own set of different specs that further diversifies the class by adding unique abilities only that spec can use as well as potentially changing the role that class plays in content. For example: As a Demon Hunter Demon Hunter you have two specs: Havoc and Vengeance. While both specs share abilities that are common to the class such as  Double Jump and  Spectral Sight, both specs have unique abilities that differentiates one spec from another. As a Havoc demon hunter, you have spells like  Blade Dance to deal out more damage, or as a Vengeance demon hunter, you have spells like  Demon Spikes and  Fiery Brand which allows you to take less damage and keep enemies off of your allies.\n\nDPS:\nIn World of Warcraft, the term DPS refers to one of two things: Damage per second (the amount of damage done per second) or DPS as a role type. DPS are the damage dealers. From a general standpoint, as a DPS it is your goal to do as much damage as possible in as short of a time period as possible. There are two types of DPS roles: Melee and Ranged. As a melee DPS, you get up close and personal with the target to deal damage. However, as a ranged DPS, you deal damage to your enemies from afar.\n*Please note: DPS will be primarily referred to as one of the role types of a class/specialization; however, there will be a few points during class analysis (such as Pros and Cons) where DPS will be referred to in the numerical sense.\nHealer:\nIn World of Warcraft, a Healer is a person who uses a variety of powerful magics to heal allies, prevent casualties, and resurrect allies. As a healer, it is your job to keep your allies alive whether it be on the battlefield or in a dungeon/raid.\nTank:\nIn World of Warcraft, the term Tank refers to a person who protects their allies from harm by absorbing/preventing damage. Additionally, it is the tank's job to keep enemies from damaging the DPS and Healer(s) as little as possible by getting up close and personal with the enemy. In a typical raid composition, MOST raid groups will use 2 tanks for the majority of the encounters they face (with there being a few exceptions depending on the raid and boss fight). However, in dungeons, only 1 tank is required.\n\nSingle Target:\nSingle target refers to the damage or healing you do to ONE target. An example of a single target damage spell is  Frostbolt. An example of a single target healing spell is  Healing Wave.\nAoE:\nAoE or Area of Effect, refers to the damage or healing you do spread across multiple targets at once. An example of an AoE damage spell is  Rain of Fire. An example of an AoE healing spell is  Essence Font.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4569, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b72a88e1-b21c-49ac-b177-5c44eca73dd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b72a88e1-b21c-49ac-b177-5c44eca73dd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "997c8e64-1f03-4a34-ba67-718ff3737c01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fcd26d8582736ad576e394703262c610651a1c900ffd80167bcd36262daa0dd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c98a625-f304-494c-8ad5-5220b98ab0c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "669c2700c442a9048406f87b371ea462a09e6208fcf1d047d9000ac562256633", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Additionally, it is the tank's job to keep enemies from damaging the DPS and Healer(s) as little as possible by getting up close and personal with the enemy.

An example of an AoE damage spell is  Rain of Fire. An example of an AoE healing spell is  Essence Font.\nCleave:\nCleave refers to a spell or ability that deals gradual AoE damage when used consecutively. Cleave can also refer to a spell that deals damage to a primary target and additional damage (also called \"splash damage\") to surrounding targets. An example of a spell that cleaves is the very unsurprising Arms warrior spell  Cleave.\nHoT:\nHoT(s) or Heal Over Time, refers to healing spells that heals one or more targets over the course of several seconds. An example of a HoT spell is  Rejuvenation.\nDoT:\nDoT(s) or Damage Over Time, refers to a spell that deals damage over the course of several seconds. An example of a DoT is  Unstable Affliction.\n\nClasses\r\nNow that we have the vocabulary out of way, let's learn about the classes!

For example, as a dk you start at level 8 instead of at level 1 (DK's that are Allied Races start at level 10 instead), you start with a mount specifically for your class, and you even have additional character customization options such as more/different hair color, eye color, and skin color options that are completely unique to your class.\r\nIncreased Mount Speed:\r\nAnother perk of being a dk is that you passively move 20% faster while mounted through your passive  On a Pale Horse which you get at level 22.\r\nThree Unique Class Mounts:\r\nWith the introduction of class mounts in patch 7.2, every class now has its own set of class mounts; however, as a dk you have not just one class mount, but three! While it might sound silly to have three class mounts, I will explain. Prior to Legion patch 7.2, only the two hero classes Death Knights and Demon Hunters as well as warlocks and paladins had class mounts. As a dk, you could acquire  Acherus Deathcharger and Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade. However, when class mounts were introduced in patch 7.2, death knights also received the ability to acquire an additional class mount:  Deathlord's Vilebrood Vanquisher which changes color based on your spec. (Blood is red, Frost is blue and white, and unholy is green).\r\nAcherus and Death Gates:\r\nAn additional perk of being a dk is access to what is known as a  Death Gate. A death gate allows you to open a gate from anywhere in the universe and transport yourself back to the dk home base: Acherus: The Ebon Hold. From Acherus (which is a floating Necropolis in the sky) you can then use your death gate again to transport yourself back to where you last were.\r\nRuneforging:\r\nLastly, one of the biggest perks as a DK is the ability to engrave your weapons with runes that enhance your combat performance in a process called  Runeforging. Runeforging replaces weapon enchants and can be placed on any of your weapons. To access the runeforge, you must go to Acherus, the Ebon Hold (Use your  Death Gate) or Seat of the Primus (Necrolord Players only) and visit a runeforge. Here is a list of possible runeforge enchantments you can place on your weapon in World of Warcraft: Shadowlands:  Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle,  Rune of the Fallen Crusader,  Rune of Razorice,  Rune of Hysteria,  Rune of Sanguination,  Rune of the Apocalypse,  Rune of Unending Thirst.", "start_char_idx": 3312, "end_char_idx": 6413, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdd21ae5-924b-4bcf-a164-f6a3e7ba1612": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdd21ae5-924b-4bcf-a164-f6a3e7ba1612", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c30e375-ff9b-4ca2-b920-060e5ac60d02", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d670be7ebe0038b8eae63b168b116a81941d035938ffac02664b69a2b244fe8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e692005d-3a34-4982-9bce-e93f1d657b0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2459022518a48fc1fe4adecbafc2cfb5887a370f539d07cb80dcf8a9453c944b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Choosing Your Class, Demon Hunter, \"Now you see, there is no sacrifice too great if it brings an end to the Burning Legion.\"\r\n-Illidan Stormrage\r\nDescription:\r\nTrained by Illidan Stormrage himself, Demon Hunters (or DH's) are trained for the sole purpose of tracking and destroying demons no matter the cost.

As a vengeance demon hunter, you are equipped with an arsenal of spells and abilities such as  Metamorphosis,  Shear, and  Demon Spikes to bolster your defenses and heal yourself as well as spells like  Torment,  Sigil of Silence,  Sigil of Misery, and  Infernal Strike to deter enemies from harming your allies.\r\nPros:\r\n- High mobility/movement\r\n- Great utility\r\n- Strong self healing\r\n- Provides a unique raid buff ( Chaos Brand)\r\nCons:\r\n- Limited active mitigation uptime\r\n- Susceptible to environmental damage\r\n- Lack of major defensive cool downs\r\n\r\nHero Class:\r\nIn World of Warcraft, Demon Hunters (as well as Death Knights) are what's known as a hero class meaning that they extra have perks that the other classes don't.

Demon hunters also allow further customization for horns, blindfolds, and tattoos.\r\nSpectral Sight and Gliding\r\nAs previously mentioned, demon hunters have a spell that enhances their vision called  Spectral Sight which allows them to see demons and enemies that are invisible or hiding behind physical objects. Other classes that wish to see hidden demons must drink Elixir of Detect Demon Elixir of Detect Demon or use other similar items. Additionally, demon hunters also have the ability to spread their demonic wings and  Glide while falling to reduce their fall speed and travel some distance before landing safely on the ground. This effect can be toggled on and off at will while double jumping or falling.\r\nTwo Class Mounts\r\nWith the introduction of class mounts in patch 7.2, every class now has its own set of class mounts; however, as a dh you have not just one class mount, but two!

Teleportation and portals spells are acquired primarily through reaching a certain level and seeing the Portal Trainer in major cities of your respective faction. Here is a full list of all teleportation and portal spells currently available in-game broken down by faction:\r\nAlliance\r\n-  Teleport: Stormwind/ Portal: Stormwind\r\n-  Teleport: Darnassus/ Portal: Darnassus\r\n-  Teleport: Ironforge/ Portal: Ironforge\r\n-  Teleport: Exodar/ Portal: Exodar\r\n-  Teleport: Theramore/ Portal: Theramore\r\n-  Teleport: Shattrath/ Portal: Shattrath\r\n-  Teleport: Tol Barad/ Portal: Tol Barad\r\n-  Teleport: Vale of Eternal Blossoms/ Portal: Vale of Eternal Blossoms\r\n-  Teleport: Stormshield/ Portal: Stormshield\r\n-  Teleport: Boralus/ Portal: Boralus\r\nHorde\r\n-  Teleport: Orgrimmar/ Portal: Orgrimmar\r\n-  Teleport: Thunder Bluff/ Portal: Thunder Bluff\r\n-  Teleport: Undercity/ Portal: Undercity\r\n-  Teleport: Silvermoon/ Portal: Silvermoon\r\n-  Teleport: Stonard/ Portal: Stonard\r\n-  Teleport: Shattrath/ Portal: Shattrath\r\n-  Teleport: Tol Barad/ Portal: Tol Barad\r\n-  Teleport: Vale of Eternal Blossoms/ Portal: Vale of Eternal Blossoms\r\n-  Teleport: Warspear/ Portal: Warspear\r\n-  Teleport: Dazar'alor/ Portal: Dazar'alor\r\nNeutral\r\n-  Teleport: Dalaran - Northrend/ Portal: Dalaran - Northrend\r\n-  Teleport: Dalaran - Broken Isles/ Portal: Dalaran - Broken Isles\r\n-  Ancient Teleport: Dalaran/ Ancient Portal: Dalaran\r\n-  Teleport: Hall of the Guardian\r\n-  Teleport: Oribos/ Portal: Oribos\r\nPolymorph Customization:\r\nAnother perk of being a mage is the ability to customize the appearance of your polymorph spell.

Additionally, as mage you also have access to  Invisibility which temporarily turns you completely invisible for 20 seconds (Arcane has an enhanced version of this effect called  Greater Invisibility).", "start_char_idx": 3058, "end_char_idx": 6763, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "febc9241-ac9e-49c0-8c50-ef329218fac9": {"__data__": {"id_": "febc9241-ac9e-49c0-8c50-ef329218fac9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a2b0e9a-4d3f-44fb-b268-cfb52befb266", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a7612dc40478243b729aa446ee638110609f9cb771a28cd012bd0632ddbb026", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "245015ca-f530-4bc9-93d7-730544cc406e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7da748206a552fa2d6e85d61c651f997bf6a069911def3a6e584db719885271e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Choosing Your Class, Monk, \"... why do we fight?

Surely they... are worth fighting for.\"\r\n-Emperor Shaohao\r\nDescription:\r\nTrained with the teachings of the Four August Celestials, monks are paragons of peace, harmony, and brewing. In combat, monks use their iron-clad discipline, martial arts skills, brews, ancient healing techniques, and regenerative mists to assist their allies. Currently, monks have three specializations: Brewmaster, Mistweaver, and Windwalker. While all three specializations wear leather armor, each spec uses different resources to cast their spells and abilities and utilizes different primary stats. Mistweavers use intellect as their primary stat and use a resource called Mana Mana to cast their spells and abilities. Brewmasters use agility as their primary stat and use two resources called Energy Energy (to cast spells and abilities) and  Stagger (to reduce damage taken). Finally, windwalkers use agility as their primary stat and use two resources called Energy Energy and Chi Chi to cast their spells and abilities.\r\nMonk Weapon Proficiency:\r\nAs a monk, you are able to use to use the following weapon types:\r\n-  Fist Weapons\r\n-  One-Handed Axes\r\n-  One-Handed Maces\r\n-  One-Handed Swords\r\n-  Polearms\r\n-  Staves\r\nMonk Spells:\r\nSome spells and abilities that ALL monks have access to include:  Transcendence,  Paralysis,  Crackling Jade Lightning, and  Roll.\r\nRaces That Can Be Monks:\r\nAlliance:\r\n- Draenei Draenei\r\n- Dark Iron Dwarf Dark Iron Dwarf\r\n- Dwarf Dwarf\r\n- Gnome Gnome\r\n- Human Human\r\n- Kul Tiran Kul Tiran\r\n- Night Elf Night Elf\r\n- Pandaren Pandaren\r\n- Void Elf Void Elf\r\n- Mechagnome Mechagnome\r\nHorde:\r\n- Blood Elf Blood Elf\r\n- Highmountain Tauren Highmountain Tauren\r\n- Mag'har Orc Mag'har Orc\r\n- Nightborne Nightborne\r\n- Orc Orc\r\n- Tauren Tauren\r\n- Pandaren Pandaren\r\n- Troll Troll\r\n- Undead Undead\r\n- Zandalari Troll Zandalari Troll\r\n- Vulpera Vulpera\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nBrewmaster monks are a type of Tank specialization that utilizes powerful and potent brews to fortify themselves and hinder their enemies. As a brewmaster monk, you are equipped with an arsenal of spells and abilities such as  Fortifying Brew,  Shuffle,  Celestial Brew, and  Zen Meditation to bolster your defenses and reduce your damage as well as  Keg Smash,  Breath of Fire, and  Blackout Kick to slow your enemies and keep them from attacking your allies. Additionally, brewmasters are unique in that their taunt effect also temporarily increases the movement speed of the enemy it's used on. While it may sound silly, it allows for enemies and bosses to be positioned quickly.\r\nPros:\r\n- High mobility/movement\r\n- Handles periodic burst damage well\r\n- Damage intake is consistent\r\n- Periodic self heals\r\n- Good utility\r\nCons:\r\n- Weak defensive cool downs\r\n- Limited self healing\r\n- Small health pool\r\n- Weak to high sustained damage\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nMistweaver monks are a type of Healer specialization that utilizes ancient healing techniques, regenerative mists, and martial arts to heal allies.

A few seconds later, the monk can then transfer themselves back to where they initially were before using  Transcendence the first time.\r\nRested Experience Bonus:\r\nOne of the biggest perks as a monk is the rested experience bonus you get leveling up from level 10-59. Starting at level 10, monks can use the spell  Zen Pilgrimage to teleport to the Peak of Serenity in Pandaria and complete a daily quest which awards  Enlightenment (a buff that grants 15% rested experience). The quest can be completed once daily in addition to every 10 levels from level 10-59.\r\nZen Pilgrimage:\r\nAnother perk of playing a monk is having the spell  Zen Pilgrimage. While it may not sound very exciting at first,  Zen Pilgrimage can act very similar to a hearthstone without the wait. On the first cast, Zen Pilgrimage takes you to the Peak of Serenity (Unless you complete the Legion intro questline for monks) and using it again teleports you back to where you previously were. If a player decides to level in Legion content, once the introductory Legion quests are completed, their Zen Pilgrimage spell is modified to teleport them to a phased, fully explorable version of The Wandering Isle (Pandaren starter zone) that has portals to the Peak of Serenity and Dalaran.", "start_char_idx": 3275, "end_char_idx": 6108, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a48df915-c3fe-4aff-aa63-6aa9c6fd5c3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a48df915-c3fe-4aff-aa63-6aa9c6fd5c3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b8d5e68-1ed6-4884-8f93-22949cca157b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "39436c218018318148ab38c4a234b792df16384e3b78e32dbf88a42d3199ae8a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6023129e-f9dc-480a-8d1e-df68e88d36bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "69443a6d34b3138b95d8c616a8182d9bb42151d36b271292e30236830124552a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Choosing Your Class, Paladin, \"We are inherently unworthy, simply because we are human, and all human beings--aye, and elves, and dwarves, and all the other races--are flawed.

On the battlefield, Paladins can be anything from holy warriors who assail their foes with holy magic, steadfast protectors who use the power of the Light to shield both themselves or allies, or healers who bestow blessings to increase their allies combat performance and utilize the benevolent, restorative properties of the Light to mend wounds.

Equipped with spells abilities such as  Blessing of Sacrifice,  Blessing of Protection, and  Divine Protection Holy Paladins bolster the defense of themselves and allies, mend wounds with  Holy Light,  Light of Dawn,  Beacon of Light and  Flash of Light, and even assail foes with holy magic with  Hammer of Justice,  Holy Shock, and  Consecration. Additionally, Holy Pallies are unique in that they are the only healer class that can sacrifice a portion of their maximum health to heal allies with  Light of the Martyr.\r\nPros:\r\n- Strong single target and spot healing\r\n- Strong utility\r\n- Good survivability\r\nCons:\r\n- Difficulty healing spread out targets\r\n- Heals from melee range\r\n- Limited mobility\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nProtection Paladins or Prot Pallies are a type of Tank specialization that utilizes the Light to bolster their defenses.

Auras are passive effects that provide a passive benefit to the paladin and their allies. Here are the auras that paladins learn leveling up:  Crusader Aura,  Devotion Aura,  Retribution Aura, and  Concentration Aura.\r\n\r\nBlessings and Divine Shield:\r\nPerhaps one the biggest perks of playing a paladin is the wide variety of defensive cd's that you have. All paladins have access to a variety of powerful defensive spells such as  Blessing of Protection,  Lay on Hands, and  Divine Shield (Which is arguably one the strongest if not the strongest defensive cd in the game).\r\nMount Speed Increase:\r\nJust like DK's, Paladins also receive a passive 20% mount speed increase at level 21 called  Crusader Aura.\r\nTwo Unique Class Mounts:\r\nWith the introduction of class mounts in patch 7.2, every class now has its own set of class mounts; however, as a pally you have not just one class mount, but two! While it might sound silly to have two class mounts, I will explain. Prior to Legion patch 7.2, only the two hero classes Death Knights and Demon Hunters as well as Warlocks and Paladins had class mounts. As a paladin, you acquire at level 10 your racial mount:\r\n Summon Exarch's Elekk (Draenei)\r\n Summon Sunwalker Kodo (Tauren)\r\n Summon Thalassian Warhorse (Blood Elves)\r\n Summon Warhorse (Humans)\r\n Summon Dawnforge Ram (Dwarves)\r\n Summon Darkforge Ram (Dark Iron Dwarves)\r\nAnd some races receive a level 20 upgrade:\r\n Summon Great Exarch's Elekk (Draenei)\r\n Summon Great Sunwalker Kodo (Tauren)\r\n Summon Thalassian Charger (Blood Elves)\r\n Summon Charger (Humans)\r\nAdditionally, after you complete the Legionfall campaign on the Broken Shore at level 45+, you can acquire an additional class mount called  Highlord's Golden Charger that flies and has 3 other color variations that you can obtain.\r\nDivine Steed Customization:\r\nAs a paladin, it always helps that you have your trusty steed wherever you go with  Divine Steed. You can customize your divine steed spell to match your preferences. As a tauren or draenei you can make your  Divine Steed look the human or blood elf horses with Glyph of the Trusted Steed Glyph of the Trusted Steed, or ALL Paladin races have access to Golden Charger's Bridle Golden Charger's Bridle when they unlock their legion class mount as well as Valorous Charger's Bridle Valorous Charger's Bridle (Holy), Vengeful Charger's Bridle Vengeful Charger's Bridle (Ret), and Vigilant Charger's Bridle Vigilant Charger's Bridle (Prot).", "start_char_idx": 3839, "end_char_idx": 6965, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "709f4c41-627a-4333-aefc-c21a86fe9381": {"__data__": {"id_": "709f4c41-627a-4333-aefc-c21a86fe9381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b620323-55e6-482e-8bab-3884fce3b05f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad592876305251cbd2c811074bd20dccc6ec59790886977f2a974a0a023d3085", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4da16a34-2f83-461d-8ed0-d57f144b5aae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4d76b69ac74cdd90bb29484e9b1df6629f92d537ece2276a2c4c53a839b1211", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Choosing Your Class, Priest, \"Blessed are the torchbearers, who bring the light to darkness.

However, the priest specs differ from each other in that Discipline and Holy are healer specs that utilize Mana Mana as their main resource for casting spells and abilities, and shadow is a DPS specialization that uses a special resource called Insanity Insanity.\r\nPriest Weapon Proficiency:\r\nAs a priest, you are able to use the following weapons:\r\n- Daggers\r\n- One-Handed Maces\r\n- Staves\r\n- Wands\r\nPriest Spells:\r\nSome spells and abilities that ALL priests have access to include:  Mass Dispel,  Mind Control,  Shackle Undead, and  Mind Soothe.\r\nRaces That Can Be Priests:\r\nAlliance:\r\n- Draenei Draenei\r\n- Dark Iron Dwarf Dark Iron Dwarf\r\n- Dwarf Dwarf\r\n- Gnome Gnome\r\n- Human Human\r\n- Kul Tiran Kul Tiran\r\n- Lightforged Draenei Lightforged Draenei\r\n- Night Elf Night Elf\r\n- Pandaren Pandaren\r\n- Void Elf Void Elf\r\n- Worgen Worgen\r\n- Mechagnome Mechagnome\r\nHorde:\r\n- Blood Elf Blood Elf\r\n- Goblin Goblin\r\n- Mag'har Orc Mag'har Orc\r\n- Nightborne Nightborne\r\n- Pandaren Pandaren\r\n- Tauren Tauren\r\n- Troll Troll\r\n- Undead Undead\r\n- Zandalari Troll Zandalari Troll\r\n- Vulpera Vulpera\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nDiscipline Priests or Disc Priests, are a type of Healer specialization that utilizes holy magic to shield allies and sear enemies with holy light as well as shadow magic that both heals allies and damages foes. Disc priests are unique in that they heal allies by dealing damage to enemies aside from their regular healing spells. As a disc priest you are equipped with an arsenal of spells and abilities such as  Power Word: Barrier,  Power Word: Shield,  Pain Suppression, and  Leap of Faith to shield and/or protect allies from harm,  Power Word: Radiance, (Spell #186263), and  Flash Heal to heal your allies, and  Penance,  Shadowfiend, and  Shadow Word: Pain to assail your foes.\r\nPros:\r\n- Unique playstyle\r\n- Strong burst healing in raids through absorbs\r\n- Strong damage reduction cool downs\r\n- Provides absorbs on allies to make it easier for them to be healed\r\nCons:\r\n- Requires high skill to play\r\n- Requires dealing damage to heal efficiently\r\n- Healing requires planning and ramp\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nHoly priests are a type of Healer specialization that utilizes holy words and the restorative powers of the holy Light to mend wounds, cure diseases, and transform into a  Spirit of Redemption that heals allies for a limited time after the priest perishes. As a holy priest, you are equipped with spells such as  Prayer of Mending,  Prayer of Healing,  Heal to mend your allies' wounds,  Holy Word: Sanctify,  Holy Word: Serenity, and  Divine Hymn to burst heal your allies, and  Guardian Spirit,  Desperate Prayer, and  Purify to protect yourself and allies.\r\nPros:\r\n- Strong burst healing\r\n- Healing can be reactive (Can apply strong healing after damage is taken)\r\n- Can heal for a limited time upon death\r\nCons:\r\n- Falls behind in healing during high movement encounters\r\n- Limited mobility\r\n- Healing falls off if targets are spread out\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nCrazed heretics and masters of shadow and void, shadow priests are a type of DPS specialization that utilizes shadow magic to cause physical and mental anguish to their enemies, the destructive power of the Void to ascend to a new form and destroy enemies, and a special resource called Insanity Insanity. As a shadow priest you encase yourself in shadow energy with  Shadowform and cause severe pain to your enemies by ripping their mind to shreds with  Mind Blast,  Mind Flay, and  Silence, and unleashing devastating shadow magic with  Shadow Word: Pain,  Shadow Word: Death, and  Shadowfiend. Additionally, shadow priests have access to (Spell #186263),  Dispersion, and  Vampiric Embrace to protect themselves from harm and heal allies if the need arises.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4205, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4da16a34-2f83-461d-8ed0-d57f144b5aae": {"__data__": {"id_": "4da16a34-2f83-461d-8ed0-d57f144b5aae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b620323-55e6-482e-8bab-3884fce3b05f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad592876305251cbd2c811074bd20dccc6ec59790886977f2a974a0a023d3085", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "709f4c41-627a-4333-aefc-c21a86fe9381", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a31680dd3587849d7769fb84a5022fba94720a4e4ca4f2d88f0914cf052136d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As a shadow priest you encase yourself in shadow energy with  Shadowform and cause severe pain to your enemies by ripping their mind to shreds with  Mind Blast,  Mind Flay, and  Silence, and unleashing devastating shadow magic with  Shadow Word: Pain,  Shadow Word: Death, and  Shadowfiend. Additionally, shadow priests have access to (Spell #186263),  Dispersion, and  Vampiric Embrace to protect themselves from harm and heal allies if the need arises.\r\nPros:\r\n- Flexible playstyle\r\n- Great sustained damage\r\n- Good utility\r\nCons:\r\n- Playstyle requires a lot of management\r\n- Damage requires the player to stand still often\r\n\r\nMass Dispel:\r\nAs a priest you have access to one of the best utility spells in the game. As the name suggests,  Mass Dispel allows you to dispel a beneficial magical effect off of 5 enemies and a harmful magical effect off 5 allies effectively allowing you to dispel a total of 10 targets in a 15 yard radius. However, there is a drawback to using this ability in succession. Using  Mass Dispel will cost you 8% of your base mana everytime you use it. While this might not seem like a lot, 8% adds up very quickly especially when used during combat in conjunction with other spells.\r\nMind Control:\r\nArguably one of the most fun spells to use in the game,  Mind Control allows the priest to temporarily take control of an enemy (this also includes other players) and move them as they see fit. While this spell doesn't have much use in PvE content, this spell is often used in PvP combat to walk enemies off of ledges in battlegrounds (which most of the time kills the enemy player) or creates the potential to isolate and/or pick off a target in arenas. However, you are not completely immune while channeling this ability. You can still be damaged and interrupted by players at any point while channeling this ability.\r\nMind Soothe:\r\nWhile it may not seem incredible,  Mind Soothe has some excellent implications in dungeon and raid content. Essentially, this spell can allow for you and your group to skip past packs of mobs that you would otherwise have to kill. This spell is especially helpful in dungeon content such as mythic plus where certain trash packs need to be skipped and your group does not have a rogue to  Sap or a demon hunter to  Imprison.\r\nLevitate:\r\nLastly, one final perk of being a priest is the ability to  Levitate people. Similar to a mage's  Slow Fall,  Levitate slows a player's fall speed. However, what makes levitate slightly better than  Slow Fall is that levitate also allows the person it's cast on to glide across water. However, the only draw back to this ability is if a player who has levitate takes damage, the spell will break.", "start_char_idx": 3751, "end_char_idx": 6448, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f82ba4ec-cb05-4d3a-88d3-92179d92b6cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "f82ba4ec-cb05-4d3a-88d3-92179d92b6cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46705ad4-3fb5-4da2-8385-897fff7f1a16", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ddb22598f74e554606ea22317dd6004cdf19b17ed114215216a3cfa4cab75a22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "94980d70-08d8-40ae-af41-9d80e6ae4c9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b5e7699ce1eda51ba339358596965ea8846c26618d12f7825fb40fd99bad149", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Choosing Your Class, Rogue, \"I have ways of making you not talk!\"\r\n-Mathias Shaw\r\nDescription:\r\nThieves, cutthroats, spies, master poisoners, assassins.

Additionally, you also have access to  Adrenaline Rush and  Roll the Bones to burst down your enemies.\r\nPros:\r\n- Strong sustained AoE and cleave\r\n- Versatile\r\n- Great utility\r\nCons:\r\n- Aspect of randomness because of  Roll the Bones\r\n- Damage is dependent on burst cooldowns\r\n- AoE is only strong if targets are close together and is capped at 5 targets\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nSubtlety rogues, or sub rogues, are a type of Melee DPS specialization that utilizes stealth and striking from the shadows to dispatch foes.

Additionally, players often tip rogues for opening lockboxes for them.\r\nPickpocket:\r\nAnother unique rogue perk is the ability to  Pick Pocket NPC's.

On the battlefield, shamans can call upon the restorative powers of water to mend wounds and heal allies, the wind to empower allies, the fortifying properties of the earth, or the destructive properties of fire to vanquish foes.

This spell is particularly useful because it cuts the amount of time you have to wait to hearth by 20 minutes (5 minutes if you're in a guild because of the Hasty Hearth guild perk).

This ability is highly desired by raid and dungeon groups alike making shamans a class that is often sought after in almost every type of group PvE content.\r\nGhost Wolf Form:\r\nStarting at level 16, shamans gain access to a spell called  Ghost Wolf which allows the shaman to transform into a ghost wolf that increases their movement speed by 30%. What's notable about this ability is that it functions similar to a druid's  Travel Form. However, while  Travel Form moves faster than  Ghost Wolf,  Ghost Wolf can be used both indoors and outside. Lastly, you can customize ghost wolf form's appearance with glyphs. Glyphs are cosmetic items created by players with Inscription Inscription which allow players to modify the visual effects of certain spells and abilities. As a shaman, these are the glyphs you can use to modify  Ghost Wolf:  Glyph of the Spectral Raptor and  Glyph of the Spectral Wolf.\r\nHex Customization:\r\nOne big perk of being a shaman is the ability to customize your  Hex spell. By default,  Hex turns the target it's cast on into a frog, but by obtaining specific items, you can change what you turn your target into (this ability can also be used on players in PvP combat). The following is a list of the different variations of the Hex spell:  Hex,  Hex, and  Hex.\r\nReincarnation:\r\nFor other classes, death is the end. However, for shamans they have a second chance at life with  Reincarnation. While this ability does have a 30 minute cool down, it can be helpful in raids when progressing on new fights in raids or in non-rated pvp to catch enemies by surprise.

All three specializations utilize Intellect as their primary stat, wear cloth armor, and utilize Mana Mana as a resource as well as a class-specific resource called Soul Shards Soul Shards to cast abilities and spells.\r\nWarlock Weapon Proficiency:\r\nAs a Warlock, you are able to use the following weapon types:\r\n-  Daggers\r\n-  One-Handed Swords\r\n-  Staves\r\n-  Wands\r\nWarlock spells:\r\nSome spells and abilities that ALL Warlocks have access to include:  Summon Imp,  Banish, and  Subjugate Demon.\r\nRaces That Can Be Warlocks:\r\nAlliance:\r\n- Dark Iron Dwarf Dark Iron Dwarf\r\n- Dwarf Dwarf\r\n- Gnome Gnome\r\n- Human Human\r\n- Void Elf Void Elf\r\n- Worgen Worgen\r\n- Mechagnome Mechagnome\r\nHorde:\r\n- Blood Elf Blood Elf\r\n- Goblin Goblin\r\n- Nightborne Nightborne\r\n- Orc Orc\r\n- Troll Troll\r\n- Undead Undead\r\n- Vulpera Vulpera\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nAffliction Warlocks are a type of Ranged DPS specialization that utilizes shadow powers to inflict various curses on their enemies as well as drain their will to live and soul. Equipped with spells such as  Agony,  Corruption, and  Unstable Affliction, you can slowly but surely defeat enemies.\r\nPros:\r\n- Strong single target damage\r\n- Good AoE cleave\r\n- Easy to learn\r\n- Able to resurrect allies during combat\r\nCons:\r\n- Bad AoE burst damage\r\n- Needs time to deal its full damage potential\r\n- Poor target swapping\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nDemonology Warlocks are a Ranged DPS specialization that specializes in tapping into the Twisting Nether to invoke an army of demons to swarm their foes. As a Demonology Warlock, you can invoke many demons with spells like  Call Dreadstalkers,  Hand of Gul'dan and  Summon Felguard, and use the souls of your dead demons to fire  Demonbolts.\r\nPros:\r\n- Strong burst damage\r\n- Flexible playstyle/builds\r\n- Able to resurrect allies during combat\r\nCons:\r\n- Damage ramps up over time\r\n- Weak AoE damage\r\n- Hard to master\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nDestruction Warlocks are a type of Ranged DPS specialization that utilizes the powers of Fel to sear enemies, rain hellfire onto them, and strike them with huge bursts of damage. Equipped with spells such as  Immolate,  Chaos Bolt and  Rain of Fire, you can literally rain down destruction on your foes. You can also damage two enemies at the same time with  Havoc.\r\nPros:\r\n- Strong burst damage\r\n- Strong cleave damage\r\n- Able to resurrect allies during combat\r\nCons:\r\n- Limited mobility\r\n- Weak single target damage\r\n- Damage is average outside of cool downs\r\n\r\nCurses:\r\nWarlocks posess a myriad of curses that can debilitate their foes. Curses are mostly potent in pvp content but also have useful implications in dungeon and raid content. Warlocks have access to the following curses:  Curse of Weakness,  Curse of Exhaustion,  Curse of Tongues\r\nDemons\r\nWarlocks of all specializations have an array of demons at their disposal. A warlock can have 1 demon up at a time, and each of them have different utilities:\r\n Summon Imp invokes an Imp that casts Firebolts at a distance, and can be used to heal minor wounds and remove bad magic effects from you.\r\n Summon Voidwalker invokes a Voidwalker that can withstand heavy punishment and tank mobs for you.\r\n Summon Succubus invokes a Succubus that attacks enemies with her whip, and can seduce them, stopping them in their tracks.\r\n Summon Felhunter invokes a Felhunter that can interrupt an enemy's spellcast, as well as devour their beneficial magic effects.\r\n Summon Felguard is exclusive to Demonology Warlocks, and invokes a Felguard that can cleave enemies and stun with its axe.\r\nHealthstones and Soulstones\r\nWarlocks have unique utility in the form of Healthstone Healthstone, an item that can used to heal a percentage of their maximum health.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4350, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d07ca4bc-c2da-40ce-89eb-8bc307fe0bb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d07ca4bc-c2da-40ce-89eb-8bc307fe0bb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d0b8359-a2f2-4843-a372-8141a252cae5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae30bad390d2cd8e1dbc6e454cb2ebdcd44cdd5f76e85a84754261f33208be69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5c241e3-bf6a-4e16-9ea7-a984ff811d75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "875ac8c00da500b74565f3920997fccc06e8b71b6c99d5e4c2a6fc3599098155", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A warlock can have 1 demon up at a time, and each of them have different utilities:\r\n Summon Imp invokes an Imp that casts Firebolts at a distance, and can be used to heal minor wounds and remove bad magic effects from you.\r\n Summon Voidwalker invokes a Voidwalker that can withstand heavy punishment and tank mobs for you.\r\n Summon Succubus invokes a Succubus that attacks enemies with her whip, and can seduce them, stopping them in their tracks.\r\n Summon Felhunter invokes a Felhunter that can interrupt an enemy's spellcast, as well as devour their beneficial magic effects.\r\n Summon Felguard is exclusive to Demonology Warlocks, and invokes a Felguard that can cleave enemies and stun with its axe.\r\nHealthstones and Soulstones\r\nWarlocks have unique utility in the form of Healthstone Healthstone, an item that can used to heal a percentage of their maximum health. You can trade healthstones with your allies, and even create many of them at the same time, thanks to  Create Soulwell. Warlocks are also one of the few classes in the game with a combat ressurrection in the form of  Soulstone. What makes this unique when compared to a Druid or Death Knight's combat ressurrection, is that you can preemptively use a Soulstone on your ally - If they die while the Soulstone is active, they can simply use it to ressurrect.\r\nSummoning Rituals\r\nWarlocks are also the only class in the game that can summon players, thanks to  Ritual of Summoning. This, in conjunction with 2 other players, allows you to create a summoning portal that can be used to summon other allies to your location.\r\nThree Unique Class Mounts:\r\nWith the introduction of class mounts in patch 7.2, every class now has its own set of class mounts; however, as a Warlock you have not just one class mount, but three! While it might sound silly to have three class mounts, I will explain. Prior to Legion patch 7.2, only the two hero classes, Death Knights and Demon Hunters as well as Warlocks and Paladins had class mounts. As a Warlock, you can acquire  Felsteed and  Dreadsteed. However, when class mounts were introduced in patch 7.2, Warlocks also received the ability to acquire an additional class mount:  Netherlord's Chaotic Wrathsteed which changes color based on your specialization. (Affliction is purple, Demonology is a firey red and orange, and Destruction is fel green).\r\nCustomizable Fire Spells:\r\nWarlocks have quite a few fire spells, and those originally have the usual fire colors and effects. However, seasoned Warlocks can pursue an epic questline to obtain  The Codex of Xerrath, a spell that corrupts all your Fire spells (as well as your  Felsteed and  Dreadsteed!) and turns them into green, fel fire!", "start_char_idx": 3480, "end_char_idx": 6180, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e0167c8-d631-4539-af64-2b2d0567dc10": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e0167c8-d631-4539-af64-2b2d0567dc10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c4336b6-8c04-44a7-b582-a0046f42644c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0deddd2fcb70f8f21e26284ff6da0d119f454e51bbeb253f8c1e9b1c30533c81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "890954bf-daf1-4120-8e1f-da80b3d9bca9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9950200dfe98090050a2d386e55a858a1241747e036e840f98eee5ff8027cb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Choosing Your Class, Warrior, \"Remember: Life is nothing without valor\"\r\n-Odyn\r\nWeapon masters, bloodthirsty berserkers, and defenders of the weak, warriors are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.

All three warrior specs utilize strength as their primary stat, wear plate armor, and use a resource called Rage Rage to cast spells and abilities.\r\nWarrior Weapon Proficiency:\r\nAs a warrior, you are able to use the following weapon types:\r\n- Shield\r\n- Bows\r\n- Crossbows\r\n- Daggers\r\n- Fist Weapons\r\n- Guns\r\n- One-Handed Maces\r\n- One-Handed Swords\r\n- Polearms\r\n- Staves\r\n- Two-Handed Axes\r\n- Two-Handed Maces\r\n- Two-Handed Swords\r\nWarrior Spells:\r\nSome spells and abilities that all warriors have access to include:  Heroic Leap,  Pummel,  Charge, and  Berserker Rage.\r\nRaces That Can Be Warriors:\r\nAlliance:\r\n-Draenei Draenei\r\n-Dark Iron Dwarf Dark Iron Dwarf\r\n-Dwarf Dwarf\r\n-Gnome Gnome\r\n-Human Human\r\n-Kul Tiran Kul Tiran\r\n-Lightforged Draenei Lightforged Draenei\r\n-Night Elf Night Elf\r\n-Pandaren Pandaren\r\n-Void Elf Void Elf\r\n-Worgen Worgen\r\n-Mechagnome Mechagnome\r\nHorde:\r\n-Blood Elf Blood Elf\r\n-Goblin Goblin\r\n-Highmountain Tauren Highmountain Tauren\r\n-Mag'har Orc Mag'har Orc\r\n-Nightborne Nightborne\r\n-Orc Orc\r\n-Pandaren Pandaren\r\n-Tauren Tauren\r\n-Troll Troll\r\n-Undead Undead\r\n-Zandalari Troll Zandalari Troll\r\n-Vulpera Vulpera\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nWeapon masters and master tacticians, arms warriors are a type of Melee DPS specialization that utilizes their weapon to sunder their opponent's armor and wreak havoc upon the battlefield.

However, these spells can also be used in tandem with each other to increase dps/generate Rage Rage.

Each zone furthers the story of World of Warcraft in some way, and is visually-themed around the related lore. For example, the areas around the human city Stormwind have similar architecture\u2014Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Duskwood, Redridge Mountains.\r\n\r\nMost zones you can freely travel to via mount or flightpath, out in the open world. A small subset of zones (dungeons, raids, PvP), have additional requirements but these are not the first zones you will encounter playing.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nZones are filled with friendly NPCs in towns, and enemy NPCs who are needed to complete objectives. In the earliest zones, the surrounding area will be mostly friendly, and the enemy mobs will not be that challenging.\r\n\r\nOn Wowhead, you can browse a full list of zones, organized by level, continent and type. Here are links to our zones in Kalimdor and Zones in Eastern Kingdoms. You can also type in the name of a zone in the search box at the top right of a page to visit zone pages like Elwynn Forest. Here you will find screenshots, helpful comments, and a list of related NPCs and quests in the zone. We also have a map on zone pages with various things you can track, represented by a row of icons underneath the map. For example, you can click on the winged boot to bring up all the flight paths in a zone, or the Hearthstone to bring up the locations for all of the Inns.\r\n\r\nTypes of Zones\r\nThere are several types of zones in World of Warcraft:\r\nQuesting Zone: This is the first type of zone you will encounter. In this type of zone, you will complete quest objectives by killing hostile mobs and looting special items. These objectives also have a story component, culminating in a climatic event when you complete all parts of a zone. We have an overview of 1-60 questing zones to help you plan your path. If you are stuck completing a quest in game, simply type the name of the quest into Wowhead and a page will pop up with a map, screenshots, and useful tips on how to complete the quest.\r\nCity: These zones are friendly areas you can explore, with shops and monuments, much like a real city. You'll reach your first city around Level 10. Each city is the political center for a faction in Warcraft, so you can immerse yourself a bit in the culture and lore. There are also some special things you can do in a city like sell items on the Auction House and access your bank to store spare items, which is covered in more detail in the World of Warcraft City Guide.\r\nInstance: These zones you will encounter periodically from level 10 onwards. Instance zones are group content that require you to be certain levels to unlock. There are several types of instanced content: dungeons (small groups), raids (large groups), and Player-vs-Player battlegrounds. If you want a change of pace from questing zones, these provide an alternative way to get experience at higher levels. The first dungeons you will encounter are The Deadmines and Ragefire Chasm.\r\nContinent: This term is used to describe the large landmass a particular zone is in. For example, the city of Stormwind is located in the continent of Eastern Kingdoms. As a new player, you will mainly stay on either Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdom, based on what starting race you pick. As you level up, you will be able to quest on additional continents\u2014Outland, Northrend, Pandaria, and Draenor.\r\n\r\nFriendly/Hostile Zones\r\nSome zones are friendly to either Alliance or Horde players, due to lore reasons. For example, a Horde player would be attacked trying to visit Stormwind. However, as a new player, you will be surrounded by friendly zones--the hostile zones are arranged to be farther away from your starting area. Wowhead zone pages will tell you if a zone is intended for one faction, or both.\r\n\r\nFriendly mobs will have green nameplates and text, neutral mobs yellow, and hostile mobs red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease refer to our World of Warcraft Race Overview to learn more about what storyline is associated with each race and faction.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to worry about other players killing you. On most types of realms, both factions of players are peaceful by default. In addition, each city, town, and low-level area has guards which attack any player actively looking for a fight.

If you are lost, and you seem to be heading towards a town but the guards have red nameplates and seem attackable, you have reached a town intended for the opposite faction.\r\nAreas in an Outdoor Zone\r\nThis next part breaks down the different areas you will encounter in an outdoor questing zone:\r\nThe town: A town is a friendly area in a zone. There are several buildings and houses, including an Inn, which you can sit in to gain rested experience. There are also NPCs that let you repair your gear. There are NPCs to add flavor to a zone who sell themed food and drink, weapons, armor. These are more to add character to the zone and you don\u2019t need to buy any of these items, although you can sell items taking up space in your bags to them. There are even some NPCs you can simply talk to, who will tell you more about the area.\r\nFlight Master: Speak to this NPC to learn a new flight path. Talking to this NPC will then open up a map of all the places you can fly to. You can only fly to areas that you\u2019ve found the Flight Master at, so don\u2019t skip talking to them. Flying from area to area is faster than walking or riding.\r\nQuest Hub: As you progress through questing and story lines, you will come across groups of friendly NPCs farther away from the town. These areas do not have as many amenities as a real Town, but you can turn in quests and possibly repair and access a mailbox.\r\nThe Road: Stay on the road to travel between destinations. The road is a friendly area where hostile mobs won\u2019t spawn. However, if you are too low-level for the area, your presence may attract hostile mobs from farther away, who may run towards the road.\r\nCaves and Mountains: Some quest objectives may seem close by on your map, but may require some extra travel because they are high above on a mountain or underground in a cave. Caves may seem a bit daunting to navigate at first, but there are special maps, as well as the minimap, to keep all the paths straight.\r\nEnemy mobs: Most of an outdoor zone will have hostile mobs which are required for different quests as you progress through a zone. Killing these mobs will grant experience. However, it is more efficient to simply kill the amount of required mobs and head back to town to turn in your quest, instead of killing infinite mobs. It is also efficient to do all the quests in a particular area at one time, instead of traveling back and forth.\r\nRares: Some enemy mobs will have a fancy silver portrait around their image. These have better-than-expected loot and experience rewards. They are not required for quest objectives but are worth defeating for their rewards.\r\nElites: Some enemy mobs will have a fancy gold portrait around their image. These are mostly found in instances, like dungeons or raids. When you see this portrait, it\u2019s a hint that you\u2019re in an area that requires a group to defeat.\r\nTreasure Chests: As you level up, you will discover chests out in the world. These may have pleasant surprises, like gear, food or drink!\r\nNatural Environment: Some areas may not appear to serve any particular purpose, but are very pretty and set the mood for the zone! Waterfalls, mountain vistas, small houses, gardens, etc. Take the time to relax and enjoy the scenery, and take a screenshot if you like the area.\r\nWorld of Warcraft Map\r\nThe in-game map helps you navigate around a zone.

Unlike questing zones or instances, there are no mobs to kill here--just a fun city to explore, hang out with other players, and catch up on in-game errands.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the useful things you can do in a city:\r\nAuction House: Buy and sell important items of value by listing or placing bids.\r\nBank: Store important items in your personal bank or your Void Storage. You can also access your guild bank, if you belong to a guild.\r\nClass Trainers: Speak to class trainers to reset your chosen specialization or learn dual specialization. These trainers are often found in a themed-area, adding a bit of personality to your chosen class.\r\nBarbershop: Change your character's hair style, color, or other customizations.\r\nExperience: You'll automatically be well-rested in a city, increasing the amount of time you'll gain experience faster when you go back out into the world.\r\nInn: Talk to an Innkeeper to set your Hearthstone Hearthstone to a major city. You can set your Hearthstone Hearthstone at Inns around the world, but it's most convenient to set it in a major city for access to features like trainers, the AH, and bank.\r\nProfession Trainers: Learn new recipes, as well as profession levels, from trainers in capital cities. These trainers are usually next to vendors who sell materials that will aid you in leveling up professions.\r\nTransportation: Cities contain useful transportation options that let you get around faster than regular gryphons: portals, zeppelins, and boats.\r\nIf you are not sure where to find something, ask a city guard NPC for directions. They will put a marker on your minimap where your destination is.\r\n\r\nEach city has a bit of local flavor and unique architecture as well. There are memorials, statues, and gardens that reflect each city's culture. Even the food and drink sold tends to vary from city to city.\r\nAlliance Cities\r\nDarnassus\r\nDarnassus is the capital town of the Night Elves. The city is arranged in a series of terraces around the central tree surrounded by a lake. Large stone structures stand next to tiered wooden shops--everything is covered in flowers and vines. The city is guarded by elemental nature protectors as well as the Sentinels. There is an aura of tranquility surrounding the nature-filled city.\r\n\r\nAreas of Interest: The Temple Gardens is at the center of Darnassus, connecting to other terraces with bridges over a central lake. Terraces surrounding the lake house trainers, battlemasters, and shopkeepers. In northern Darnassus you will find The Howling Oak, a new home for Gilnean refugees. The Temple of the Moon is the center of worship for the Sisters of Elune, where Tyrande Whisperwind and Malfurion Stormrage reside.\r\n\r\nTransportation: Darnassus is located in Teldrassil, north west of Kalimdor. The most common way to reach Darnassus is to take a boat from Stormwind to Rut'theran Village and then use the large teleport in Rut'theran. Darnassus is a city you'll encounter naturally as either a Night Elf, Draenei or Worgen.\r\n\r\nDarnassus has a portal to Exodar, and boats to both Exodar and Stormwind.\r\n\r\nHistory: In the aftermath of the Third War, the night elves had to adjust to their mortal existence. Such an adjustment was far from easy, and there were many night elves who could not adjust to the prospects of aging, disease and frailty. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward druids conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world.\r\n\r\nWith Malfurion Stormrage missing, Fandral Staghelm--the leader of those who wished to plant the new World Tree--became the new Arch-Druid. He and his fellow druids had forged ahead and planted the great tree, Teldrassil, off the stormy coasts of northern Kalimdor. However, it was corrupted by the Burning Legion and the night elves never regained their immortality.\r\n\r\nDarnassus in Battle for Azeroth: Due to the events of the War of the Thorns, Darnassus was burned down and ultimately destroyed by the Horde, lead by Sylvanas Windrunner. The survivors of the war moved and settled in Stormwind City, whilst some others were evacuated to the Azuremyst Isle. The Alliance response to the Horde for these events was the Siege of Lordaeron.\r\n\r\n\r\nExodar\r\nThe Exodar is the capital city of the Draenei.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4406, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd824544-0e01-470a-b312-8dc9bb1c14ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd824544-0e01-470a-b312-8dc9bb1c14ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "227e154e-84df-4cb6-9ead-5821c657b052", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "53129c865956be5655ab0a2a16a9fd8eb45f14b3680952bb4c46f52caa55891c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56db4b96-818a-462b-b66b-60fe7db13c21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ecd9f31dad4bc8ebd388eb688c32d070fb3dd84bcf55c85ae35fe9d5642fabc7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50d41398-6c2c-4dc1-b88f-f50f9e9da7bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1b67f2c9c9891cfd35c539c3f0886b9a5f140d9a6bd0e5edd0821dc803e111e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "With Malfurion Stormrage missing, Fandral Staghelm--the leader of those who wished to plant the new World Tree--became the new Arch-Druid.

It is located in the westernmost part of Azuremyst Isle. The Exodar's faction leader is Prophet Velen, who is located near the battlemasters in the Vault of Lights. The Exodar is brightly-colored and covered in crystals and glowing lights.\r\n\r\nAreas of Interest: The Exodar is split into the Seat of the Naaru, home of O'ros the naaru, with three wings. The Crystal Hall is home to a crystal mine and class trainers, including Shaman who give players Elemental Sapta Elemental Sapta allowing them to see elementals. The Vault of Lights is the central tiered wing where Prophet Velen resides. It is also home to a holographic museum showing the horrors of the Burning Legion the Draenei have continually been escaping from over thousands of years. The Trader's Tier is where you will find profession and guild vendors.\r\n\r\nTransportation: The Exodar is located in northern Kalimdor on Azuremyst Isle. It is a bit out of the way, and the most common way to reach the city is to take a portal from Darnassus. Draenei are most likely to frequent this city. There is also a boat connecting the Exodar to Darnassus.\r\n\r\nHistory: The history of the Exodar is a short one, as the draenei only recently raised it around the husk of their crashed ship, which is still smoking from the impact. The Exodar was once a naaru satellite structure around the dimensional fortress Tempest Keep. The Exodar contains a large amount of technological wonders (due to its origins lying with the Tempest Keep) such as magically enchanted \"wires\" which transport holy energy throughout the ship to power the heating and lighting.\r\n\r\nIronforge\r\nIronforge is the capital city of the dwarves. It is am intricate circular cavern carved into the mountains of Dun Morogh, with a massive forge near flight paths at the center. It is primarily populated by dwarves, but there is a strong gnomish presence in Tinker Town.\r\n\r\nAreas of Interest: The Hall of Explorers is home to the Ironforge Library and Museum, maintained by the Explorer's League which is interested in learning more about the Titan origins of the dwarves. The Great Forge is an impressive sight to behold, with a large pool of molten lava. The Throne Room is home to the three leaders from each clan; you can take a turn down into Old Ironforge, a series of stairways and tunnels leading to Magni Bronzebeard, the former leader of Ironforge now encased in crystals.\r\n\r\nTransportation: Ironforge is located in central Eastern Kingdoms. Gnomes, dwarves, and humans will encounter this city frequently. The most common way to reach Ironforge is by taking the Deeprum Tram from Stormwind. From Ironforge, you can take the tram back to Stormwind or portal to the Dark Portal.\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\nIronforge is the ancient home of the dwarves. A marvel to the dwarves' skill at shaping rock and stone, Ironforge was constructed in the very heart of the mountains, an expansive underground city home to explorers, miners, and warriors. Before the Dark Iron Clan was banished from the city, eventually leading to the War of the Three Hammers, Ironforge was the commercial and social center of all the dwarven clans. Once dominated by the Bronzebeard Clan, the Dark Iron and Wildhammer clans have a strong presence in Cataclysm.\r\n\r\nRelatively recently, Ironforge also became home to the Gnomeregan refugees. After the Third War, the gnomish city of Gnomeregan became overrun by troggs. Since then, a number of gnomes have settled in Ironforge, converting an area of that city to their liking, an area now known as Tinker Town.", "start_char_idx": 3607, "end_char_idx": 7947, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50d41398-6c2c-4dc1-b88f-f50f9e9da7bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "50d41398-6c2c-4dc1-b88f-f50f9e9da7bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "227e154e-84df-4cb6-9ead-5821c657b052", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "53129c865956be5655ab0a2a16a9fd8eb45f14b3680952bb4c46f52caa55891c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd824544-0e01-470a-b312-8dc9bb1c14ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad68b19f9440c2297936318828bc95566257bde44be63d1ebd038acd8f3d6d31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "64b0bf94-830b-49ba-96dd-a52c764ad996", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14207f0ac9e4fc961a663fda1c7631373bdd0d3025df3cace9c360d8de760a98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "History:\r\nIronforge is the ancient home of the dwarves.

It is located in the northwestern part of Elwynn Forest. Formerly ruled by the young child king Anduin Wrynn (with the help of Highlord Bolvar Fordragon, the former regent, and Lady Katrana Prestor), it is now ruled over by King Varian Wrynn who returned during the time of the Lich King.\r\n\r\nAreas of Interest:\r\nStormwind is divided into districts, separated by canals. In the Mage Quarter, you will find a mystical tower where mages study, as well as the seedy inn The Slaughtered Lamb where Warlocks lurk. The Trade District is one of the busiest areas in the game, where players congregate naturally, as well as home to the suspicious Trias cheese shop. In the Valley of Heroes, you will find monuments to heroes from the Second War. In Old Town, you'll find the home of rogue organization SI:7, while in Cathedral Square, you'll find the magnificent Cathedral of Light, as well as the City Hall and Orphanage. Behind the Cathedral you will find Stormwind's massive graveyard, including a monument to Varian's wife.\r\n\r\nStormwind Keep is the political heart of the Alliance; here you will find the throne room and leaders.\r\n\r\nLion's Rest - 'a place of contemplation and remembrance' - can be found between Cathedral Square and the Mage Quarter. It was built over the site of the former Park and Old Barracks, destroyed by Deathwing.\r\n\r\nStormwind is home to a number of cultural references and Easter Eggs, including Bernard Gump and Elizabeth Birdsong. The auctioneers are named after some Blizzard employees as well!\r\n\r\nTransportation: Stormwind is a major transportation hub. The Stormwind Harbor has boats to Teldrassil in Kalimdor and Borean Tundra in Northrend. The Dwarven District in Stormwind also provides easy access to Ironforge. There is a hub of portals you can unlock at higher levels that will connect you to some questing zones as well. Stormwind is mostly used by Humans while leveling, but it's a busy city for all races.\r\n\r\nHistory During the First War, the Kingdom of Azeroth, including its capital, Stormwind Keep, was utterly destroyed by the Horde and its survivors fled to Lordaeron. After the orcs were defeated at the Dark Portal at the end of the Second War, it was decided that the city would be rebuilt. The nobles of Stormwind assembled a team of the most skilled and ingenious stonemasons and architects they could find--which later turned sour and led to the rise of the Defias.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the northern kingdoms, Stormwind is by far the most populated city in the world. It serves in many ways as the cultural and trade center of the Alliance, even with remote access to the sea. It is home to the Academy of Arcane Sciences, the only wizarding school in Eastern Kingdoms, as well as SI:7, a rogue intelligence organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorde Cities\r\nOrgrimmar\r\nOrgrimmar is the capital city of the Horde, with large settlements of trolls, orcs, tauren, and goblins. At the start of World of Warcraft, the position of Warchief was held by Thrall. It was later passed to Garrosh Hellscream, and after a period of political turmoil, the troll Vol'jin is now the Warchief.\r\n\r\nAreas of Interest: The Valley of Strength lies at the center of Orgrimmar, home to the residing Warchief and much of the city's commerce. The Valley of Spirits is more residential, with neighborhoods for the Goblins and Trolls reflecting their distinctive cultures.

There is a hub of portals you can unlock at higher levels that will connect you to some questing zones as well.\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\nThrall led the orcs to the continent of Kalimdor, where they founded a new homeland, naming it Durotar after Thrall's murdered father. Rising above their past bloodshed and demonic curse, the orcs built a society based on survival and prosperity rather than conquest.\r\n\r\nNamed after the former Warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, Orgrimmar was constructed in a short amount of time, with the aid of goblins, tauren, trolls, and Rexxar. Orgrimmar has undergone a visual update when Garrosh took control, to look more aggressive and militaristic with numerous spikes and fortifications.\r\n\r\nToday, Orgrimmar lies at the base of a mountain between Durotar and Azshara. Times have changed though, since Garrosh's reign as Warchief--he has alienated several races due to his aggressive and insecure nature. In the raid Siege of Orgrimmar, players can see the result of Garrosh's damage to the city and fight to reclaim it for its citizens.\r\n\r\nSilvermoon City\r\nSilvermoon City is the capital of the Blood Elves. It is an elegant city, showing off the wealth and refined tastes of its citizens. The city is covered in gold decorations, reflecting the Blood Elves' love of the sun.\r\n\r\nAreas of Interest: The Walk of Elders is the central hub of the city, with autumnal trees and numerous benches lining the paths, as well as the residence of the famous band The Tauren Chieftans. Sunfury Spire is home to the Royal Palace and Court of the Sun, where Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron resides, surrounded by his advisers and magical libraries. Farstrider Square is home to two Blood Elf groups: the Farstriders, a group of rangers, and the formidable Blood Knight Paladins. The Bazaar is the flourishing business center of Silvermoon and home to the grand Wayfarer's Inn, but the nearby Murder Row reveals a more sinister side in the darkened alleyways, as well as Keelen's Trustworthy Tailoring which hires leper gnomes to work nonstop in the basement. While Silvermoon appears to be a flourshing city, the magical green crystals throughout the city remind the player that the Blood Elves are addicted to magic.\r\n\r\nTransportation: Silvermoon City is primarily visited by Blood Elves while leveling, as it's a bit out of the way in northern Eastern Kingdoms. You can get to Silvermoon City easily from Undercity via the Orb of Translocution.\r\n\r\nHistory: The city of Silvermoon was founded by the high elves after their arrival in Lordaeron thousands of years ago. The city was constructed in the style of the ancient Kaldorei Empire. The city contained the famous Academies of Silvermoon as a center for the learning of Arcane Magic and Sunstrider Spire, a majestic palace home to the Royal family of the high elves. The Convocation of Silvermoon (also known as \"The Silvermoon Council\"), the ruling body of the high elves was also based here.\r\n\r\nAlthough Silvermoon itself was left relatively unscathed from the second war, in the third war the Death Knight Arthas led the Scourge into the city, attacking it on his quest to reach the Sunwell. The High Elven King was slain and the majority of the population killed.\r\n\r\nSilvermoon today is only the eastern half of the original city; the western half was almost completely destroyed by the Scourge during the Third War.", "start_char_idx": 10787, "end_char_idx": 15213, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f47fe674-3fb2-447d-8b54-26746514fb87": {"__data__": {"id_": "f47fe674-3fb2-447d-8b54-26746514fb87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "227e154e-84df-4cb6-9ead-5821c657b052", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "53129c865956be5655ab0a2a16a9fd8eb45f14b3680952bb4c46f52caa55891c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64b0bf94-830b-49ba-96dd-a52c764ad996", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14207f0ac9e4fc961a663fda1c7631373bdd0d3025df3cace9c360d8de760a98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2f71eec-3262-4ef5-a078-6c9a5f4117e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62f583b3b923cbcf9ba3f2a66b147241abea80886d18f63b7adb87752c92c73f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The city was constructed in the style of the ancient Kaldorei Empire.

Falconwing Square, the second blood elf town, is the only part of western Silvermoon remaining in blood elf control.\r\n\r\n\r\nThunder Bluff\r\nThunder Bluff is the Tauren capital city located in the northern part of the region of Mulgore. The whole of the city is built on bluffs several hundred feet above the surrounding landscape, and is accessible by elevators on the southwestern and northeastern sides.\r\n\r\nAreas of Interest: The High Rose on the central mesa is home to High Chieftan Baine Bloodhoof. Nearby is an open-air auditorium used to make important events. Elder Rise is the spiritual center of Thunder Bluff, home to the Council of Elders and the Cenarion Circle. The Spirit Rise is the center for Shaman training, with the Pool of Visions below. The final plateau, Hunter Rise, is home to military training, the Hunter's Hall, and Sunwalker Lodge.\r\n\r\nTransportation: Thunder Bluff is primarily used by Taurens while leveling. To access the city on top of the plateau, you must take one of the elevators up. If you fall off the city, you will take fall damage and die. Within the city, there are three distinctive plateaus off of a main plateau that has multiple tiers--Lower to the southwest, Middle to the northeast, and High to the east.\r\n\r\nThunder Bluff is connected to Orgrimmar via a zeppelin.\r\n\r\nHistory: Thunder Bluff lies atop a series of mesas overlooking Mulgore. The once nomadic Tauren recently built the city as a center for trade caravans, traveling craftsmen and artisans of every kind. It was established by the mighty chief Cairne Bloodhoof after the Tauren, with help from the orcs, drove away the centaurs that originally inhabited Mulgore.\r\n\r\nUndercity\r\nThe Undercity is the capital city of the Undead. It is built under the remains of the city of Lordaeron. It is foul and dark, with twisted gothic architecture and plague-green canals. The Undercity is laid out in a circular pattern, with four wings off of a central canal.\r\n\r\nAreas of Interest: On your way to the Undercity, you'll find the Lordaeron Throne Room--untouched from years of political upheaval. If you look closely, you'll find a trail of blood on the ground near the throne. Proceeding into the city, you'll come across the sinister Apothecarium, home to the Royal Apothecary Society which seeks to create plague to use against enemies. Each quarter in the Undercity is devoted to a different type of combat, with the Magic Quarter the most sinister as it houses the Temple of the Damned devoted to necromatic energies.\r\n\r\nTransportation: The Undercity is a major hub for zeppelins, which travel to Orgrimmar, Howling Fjord in Northrend, and Grom'gol in Stranglethorn Vale. There is also an orb, off to the right of the Ruins of Lordaeron, that lets you quickly teleport to Silvermoon City.\r\n\r\nThe Undercity is a bit challenging for new players to navigate at first, as it is underground the Ruins of Lordaeron. To enter the city, pass by the courtyard and throne room into any of the winding passageways.

To enter the city, pass by the courtyard and throne room into any of the winding passageways. You will find an elevator, guarded by Abominations, that takes you down into the city.\r\n\r\nHistory: The Undercity was originally simply a system of sewers, crypts, and catacombs beneath the Capital City of Lordaeron. After the city was destroyed by the Scourge, Arthas had the underground warren expanded and rebuilt. He originally intended for the Undercity to be his seat of power, from which he would rule the Plaguelands. However, shortly after the Third War ended, Arthas was forced to return to Northrend and save the Lich King. In his absence, Sylvanas Windrunner and her rebel Undead captured the ruins of the city. Soon after, she discovered the massive underground fortress, and decided to establish it as the main base of operations for the Undead Forsaken.\r\n\r\nAfter the Forsaken were betrayed by Grand Apothecary Putress at Wrathgate, who split off from the Horde to launch a lethal chemical assault, the Forsaken were nevertheless mistrusted by the rest of the Horde. They have tried to demonstrate their loyalty in various ways, such as attacking the kingdom of Gilneas.\r\n\r\nUndercity in Battle for Azeroth: Following the events of the Burning of Teldrassil, the Alliance set out to repay the favor to the Horde through the Siege of Lordaeron. This battle was fought for the control of Undercity and resulted in the Alliance's victory. However, their victory was snatched from their palms as the Horde ended up destroying Undercity and leaving the Alliance with nothing more than the Ruins of Lordaeron.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigher-Level Cities\r\nAt higher levels, you will come across cities for both factions. Here are a few of the notable ones.\r\nDalaran\r\nDalaran is a magocratic city-state and was once located within the Alterac Mountains in the Eastern Kingdoms. Now, the city, including the Violet Citadel, resides above the Crystalsong Forest in Northrend. The top part of the city is sparkling and airy, while the sewers underground show the darker side of magic addiction and luxury.\r\n\r\nThe Violet Citadel is center of the Kirin Tor, with portals to the luxury balcony bar The Purple Parlor, as well as the secret room Archmage Vargoth's Retreat. There are lavish areas for the Alliance and Horde, the Silver Enclave and Sunreaver's Sanctuary, that include luxury inns and other nice touches like a beer garden. Dalaran is home to the Antonidas Memorial, named after Archmange Antonidas, a former leader of the Kirin Tor who was killed by Arthas. There is also a special fountain--fish up enough coins and you could get Titanium Seal of Dalaran Titanium Seal of Dalaran.\r\n\r\nThe shops of Dalaran reflect the luxury of the city. There are shops for wine and cheese, companion pets, hats, and shirts. The area for the profession trainers is whimsical, with each shop reflecting the theme of each profession. For example, the Herbalism NPC is found in a conservatory while the Jewelcrafting NPC is in a jewelry shop.\r\n\r\nDalaran was introduced as the neutral city for the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, similiar to how Shattrath City was introduced as the neutral city for the The Burning Crusade expansion.\r\n\r\nDalaran has always attracted mages from its very beginnings, serving as a center for magic and research. Unfortunately, this strong center for magic also attracted the Burning Legion. Unwilling to give up magic, the inhabitants of Dalaran appointed a Guardian as well as the Order of Tirisfal for protection, and founded the Kirin Tor to document all magic in Azeroth. Although it had Alliance ties, Dalaran remained politically neutral, believeing itself above petty politics.\r\n\r\nDalaran was first destroyed by Archimonde, summoned by Kel'Thuzad from Medivh's spellbook which Arthas acquired. However, the mages were redetermined to build the city even grander than before. This city was later moved to Northrend to better fight the threats of Malygos and Arthas in Wrath of the Lich King.\r\n\r\nGoblin Cities\r\nBooty Bay is a large pirate town on the southern tip of The Cape of Stranglethorn.

Run by the Blackwater Raiders who are closely associated with the Steamwheedle Cartel, Booty Bay is a neutral city and major quest hub with a lot of character. With the world renowned Salty Sailor Tavern, (World Event #301), numerous profession trainers, and vendors that sell everything from pets to diamond rings, it is one of the most popular locations in Azeroth. The Inn is even shaped like a boat.\r\n\r\nBaron Revilgaz rules the city: his major threat are the Bloodsail Buccaneers. He resides, together with the leader of the Blackwater Raiders, Fleet Master Seahorn, at the top of the inn of Booty Bay.\r\n\r\nBooty Bay is one of several neutral Goblin cities--the others are Everlook, Gadgetzan, and Ratchet.

A former naaru temple, Shattrath was destroyed by the Orcs during their rampage across Draenor prior to the First War. The Sha'tar, or \"born of light,\" are naaru that aided the Aldor, the order of draenei priests formerly led by Velen, in rebuilding Shattrath City.\r\n\r\nThe entity that leads the Sha'tar is known as A'dal; he can be found upon the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City. The Aldor and the Scryers are two factions working with Shattrath against the Burning Legion, but feud with each other. The Aldor are a draenic priesthood working with the Sha'tar, while the Scyrers are a group of formerly-hostile blood elves that recently offered to aid Shattrath. These factions have different tiered areas high above the center of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Lower City is its own faction--it is comprised of war-torn refugees of all races. Profession trainers and vendors with unique recipes are located down here, as well as the World's End Tavern with a variety of colorful NPCs including a band and comedy show.\r\n\r\n\r\nShrine of the Seven Stars/Two Moons\r\nShrine of Seven Stars and Shrine of Two Moons are lavish cities serve as the Alliance and Horde hubs for players in Pandaria. They are located on either side of Mogu'shan Palace in Vale of Eternal Blossoms.\r\n\r\nBoth cities have an elaborately-tiered floorplan. On the ground floor, you'll find representatives from all the factions with tasks for you to complete. Sweeping staircases take you up to the terrace and main level, where you will find the grand entrance, Inn, Bazaar, and Pandaren sharing their hospitality. On the top floor, you'll find many portals, vendors, and useful NPCs. Even the mundane parts of the city are elaborately designed, with carvings, gilt, decorative tiles, and detailed ceilings. Both cities reflect the prosperity and culture of the Pandaren.\r\n\r\nDazar'alor\r\nCloistered between two mountain ranges in Zuldazar, Dazar'alor is the seat of power of the Zandalari Empire and a lively trade port that boasts exotic goods from all over Azeroth (and even beyond).

These items can be stored in a backpack, bank, or void storage. A subset of items, gear, can be equipped on the player and has a unique appearance everyone nearby will see.\r\n\r\nThere are many different categories of items:\r\nWeapons: Held in character\u2019s hands, these offer substantial increases to player power, and in the case of melee, greatly affect the amount of damage a player deals.\r\nArmor: Armor serves two purposes as clothing in World of Warcraft. Each piece of armor increases your character\u2019s power by added stats, and in some cases like trinkets, additional bonus effects. Each armor piece also has unique visuals and many players enjoy finding matching pieces of armor to express their personality.\r\nContainers: Players can acquire additional bags to store their new items. Many bags are multi-purpose, but some are specific to professions. For example, Burnished Inscription Bag Burnished Inscription Bag is roomier than your average bag, but only holds Inscription items.\r\nConsumables: These types of items temporarily buff a player, such as Flasks to increase a stat for a few hours, food to regain your health, and enchants to give your weapon additional effects. These items are usually made by players that have trained in a specific profession, and can be traded or bought on the Auction House.\r\nGlyphs: A glyph is a scroll that enhances certain abilities, either giving them additional utility or a cosmetic effect like changing the color of a spell.\r\nTrade Goods: You will need these items to create consumables, whether it\u2019s meat for food that buffs your stats, herbs for Alchemy potions, or leather for Armor.\r\nRecipes: When players learn a profession, they discover how to craft items via recipes. Recipes can be acquired many different ways\u2014several popular sources are trainers, bosses, and reputation grinds.\r\nGems: At higher levels, players can socket gems into their gear. Gems with stronger stat gains are available as players level up.\r\nMounts: Many players love collecting mounts, adding to their collection totals.\r\nPets: Some battle pets can be captured directly in the world, but others are found as items from bosses, vendors, etc. Clicking on the pet item will teach you the pet permanently.\r\nQuest: When completing a quest, sometimes you will be required to loot a specific item. These items will not take up bag space when you acquire them.\r\nItem Tooltips and Terms\r\nAn item\u2019s tooltip reveals many useful details about an item.\r\n\r\nQuality: The name of an item will be in a certain color: Poor, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary. These colors roughly show how important and useful an item is.\r\nItem Level: This increases the overall level of your gear. As you level up and look for groups for challenging content, some leaders may require your item level to be above a certain number to prove you are not undergeared for the content.\r\nBind Information: Items can have the following bind types:\r\nBind on Equip: These items refer to gear which can be traded or sold on the AH until a character equips it.\r\nBinds when Used: These items cover some toys, pets, and mounts which can be traded or bought until someone learns the item.\r\nBinds to Account: Commonly referred to as heirlooms, these items can be passed around all characters on your account, including gear that is already worn.\r\nBinds when Picked Up: This is what most equippable gear is classified as\u2014an item you acquire (questing, a boss, crafting)-with the specific intent you\u2019ll use it. When you have no more need for the item, you can sell or Disenchant it, or hold onto it in your bags for its visual appearance.\r\nRestrictions: Sometimes an item will list additional restrictions, like 3 crafting items, or a profession requirement. Other items can only be equipped by a certain class, for example a piece of armor that boosts an ability only one class has.\r\nStats and Effects: This part of the tooltip will show the stats you will gain by equipping an item or using a consumable. For gear, if you mouse over an item\u2019s tooltip, it will automatically compare that item to your equipped item to show gains and loses.\r\nLevel Requirement: This shows what level your character must be to equip something. If you are too low-level to equip something, you can hold onto it in your bags until you are old enough to use it.\r\nFlavor Text: Only a handful of items have flavor text. This does not add anything to an item, but denotes it has some special place in the game\u2019s lore and reveals a little about the item\u2019s previous history.\r\n\r\nAcquiring Items\r\nItems can be acquired many ways:\r\n\r\nAchievement: These items are rare and special, they are rewards for completing a large amount of content.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4769, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da20c571-3e49-4a83-a163-7af880c5070f": {"__data__": {"id_": "da20c571-3e49-4a83-a163-7af880c5070f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ed0dfe8-6ca0-4ac9-b3f1-6e0351843b51", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2571fe15a1beb7c530bbf3d7407954b6179f126756315e67924fbb72df4e5e2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3dd1b7e-f68e-4a18-94c0-e1926786f563", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a6e2a9c86789bff506b380ee14188ab2f63b2713745c27bc46931fe03034f7f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f86a35b-9b04-481f-9e5e-76c215201be9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "46f789b1cfbd91a2a0ea271f6b8cd754d370c2cb3b5dc630809c893a2cca8787", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Stats and Effects: This part of the tooltip will show the stats you will gain by equipping an item or using a consumable.

Accessing your Void Storage can only be done in Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Mists of Pandaria, and Warlords capital cities.\r\nCreate a \u201cbank alt\u201d designed to hold onto miscellaneous items.\r\nBlizzard has automatic built-in storage for some vanity collections: Mounts, Pets, Toys, and Heirlooms. Click on \"Shift-P\" to open up the collection tab. From there, you can click on an item to summon or use it. These items are mostly just-for-fun and we have guides to each type of collection: the Warlords Mount Guide, Toy Box Guide, Heirloom List, and Battle Pet Guides. The in-game collection tab has additional information on these types of items, such as their source and attributes.\r\nGetting Rid of Items\r\nThere are several ways to get rid of items you do not want.\r\nDelete: Delete an item by clicking on it, then clicking on the center of your screen. If the item is of a good quality, you will have to type \u201cDelete\u201d when prompted to verify you want to delete the useful item. Deleting an item should be a last resort, as you do not get any gold for removing the item this way.\r\nSell to Vendor: This is a safer way to handle junk items you do not want. You can go up to a merchant NPC, click on their \u201cSell\u201d tab and then right-click on items you do not want. As each item is sold, you will gain small amounts of gold. The junk items in your bag will have little gold icons in the corner, indicating they have no real purpose other than to be sold. It is still worth looting and selling trash, vs completely ignoring it, as some items reward a decent amount of gold like Robble's Staff of Herding Robble's Staff of Herding.\r\nMail: You can mail items to anyone on your realm (same faction) or any of your characters on your account.\r\nTrade: If you have a friend that needs a particular item, go up to that player, click on their portrait, and select the Trade option. Drag the item into the window that opens up so they can accept the trade.\r\nAuction House: If an item seems particularly valuable, you can list it on the AH in a major city. For example, a BoE piece of gear with a unique model or a rare profession material you have no use for. Use the Auction House UI to see if other people have listed the same item, to get a sense of how rare your item is and how you should price it.\r\nDisenchant: Enchanters have the option to shard useful items for crafting materials, which are then used to craft powerful enchants. High-level players in Warlords of Draenor can build an Enchanter's Study and use it to disenchant items, even if they do not have the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nGear Basics and Stats\r\nGear is a subset of items that your character can wear. This gear has two purposes: to affect the appearance of your character, and to strengthen your character\u2019s power.\r\n\r\nFor information on item appearances and how to alter the appearance of your gear, please visit our Transmogrification Tools Overview and Transmog Guide section.\r\n\r\nAt low levels, you do not need to worry too much about the stats on your gear.

You can right-click on your character portrait to set your Loot Specialization. You can set your Loot Specialization to a different spec than your current one, if you are interested in collecting off-spec loot.\r\n\r\nBy pre-selecting a loot specialization, all items acquired from questing, Bonus Rolls, and LFR will be suited to your specialization.

The Eredar created a rich and magical society on Argus, which caught Sargeras\u2019 attention. He promised the three Eredar leaders, Kil'jaeden, Archimonde, and Velen, even more magic and power if they pledged loyalty. Velen saw through the plan and instead escaped with the remaining uncorrupted Eredar, while his fellow leaders were corrupted and joined the Burning Legion. Fleeing from planet to planet, they eventually settled on the Orcish home world of Draenor. After a period of peace, many were brutally murdered during Gul\u2019dan\u2019s corruption of the Orcs and formation of the Horde. The survivors escaped on a spaceship, the Exodar, crashing it on Azeroth.\r\n\r\nCapital City: The Draenei have the seat of their power in the ruins of their once-great ship, The Exodar.

They went into hibernation in Titan cities for thousands of years following the Sundering, emerging to find themselves mortal.\r\n\r\nThere are three main clans of dwarves vying for power in Ironforge: the Bronzebeards, Wildhammers, and Dark Irons. The Bronzebeards are fascinated by archaeology, forming the Explorer's Guild to learn more about their fabled past and link to the titans. The Wildhammer Clan values close ties to nature, studying shamanism and tending to the gryphons you'll find all over Azeroth for transportation. The Dark Iron clan has recently freed themselves from the evil Sorcerer Thaurissan and elemental lord Ragnaros, led by Queen Moira Bronzebeard.\r\n\r\nCapital City: The dwarves make their home in their ancestral seat of Ironforge.

The city of Gnomeregan initially fell when faced with a surprise invasion by the troggs. The radiation treatment to kill the troggs instead weakened them, and they spread throughout the city, infecting and killing many Gnomish citizens. To make matters worse, Gelbin's adviser Sicco Thermaplugg engineered the defense failure, hoping to frame Gelbin and seize control of the city. The gnomes stood beyond Gelbin and made their way to Ironforge for refuge; Thermaplugg remained inside Gnomeregan and became king of the leper gnomes.\r\n\r\nCapital City: The gnomes now make their home in Ironforge; they have made efforts to retake their beloved former city as well.\r\n\r\nZones: Gnomes start off questing in New Tinkertown, a subsection of Dun Morogh that the Gnomes regained control of from the troggs and leper gnomes.

The nobles of Stormwind assembled a team of the most skilled and ingenious stonemasons and architects they could find--which later turned sour and led to the rise of the Defias.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the northern kingdoms, Stormwind is by far the most populated city in the world. It serves in many ways as the cultural and trade center of the Alliance, even with remote access to the sea. It is home to the Academy of Arcane Sciences, the only wizarding school in Eastern Kingdoms, as well as SI:7, a rogue intelligence organization.\r\n\r\nZones: Humans begin questing in Elwynn Forest, a quiet countryside zone bordering Stormwind.

Create your character's appearance in Wowhead's Dressing Room.\r\n\r\nCulture: The humans were descended from Vrykul affected by the Curse of Flesh; instead of killing the weaker members of the tribe, some families escaped to start life afresh.\r\n\r\nThe humans revere the Titan Tyr, whose actions reflected his selfless nature, that sacrifice is required for justice. When Tyr decided to steal the Discs of Norgannon from Loken, a betrayer of the Titans, many titan-forged creations now cursed decided to escape with him. This escape led to a dramatic showdown between Tyr and two of Loken's greatest generals, in which Tyr sacrificed himself to destroy the enemy. Moved by this sacrifice, the vrykul decided to guard Tyr's resting place and settle in the new land--Tirisfal.\r\n\r\nThis loyalty and nobility in humans has led them to create massive armies and the Knights of the Silver Hand Paladin Order.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight Elf\r\nnightelves.pngOverview: The night elves are a mysterious race whose thirst for magic and power created a flourishing, yet corrupt, ancient empire. This empire had a dark side, drawing the attention of the Burning Legion which led to the War of the Ancients and The Sundering, a massive arcane explosion that ripped the world apart. The new generation of night elves shunned arcane magic and instead rebuilt their civilization to live in harmony with nature. They lived in Kalimdor for thousands of years, undisturbed until the world tree and their immortality was sacrificed to halt a new advance of the Burning Legion prior to the events of World of Warcraft.\r\n\r\nCapital City: The night elf capital city is Darnassus, situated in the branches of the world tree itself.

Tyrande, the High Priestess of Elune, served as the sole ruler of the Night Elves during the Long Vigil while Malfurion slept in the Emerald Dream. Malfurion was the first Druid and formed the Cenarion Circle, an order devoted to protecting nature and druidic traditions.\r\n\r\nNight Elf culture is matriarchal, with most women as warriors and men as Druids (although the rules have grown less restrictive in years, commemorated in  Druid and Priest Statue Set). The Sentinels are skilled warriors, fighting either with glaives or bows at range. You can find Sentinels defending any of the major Night Elf cities. The Sisters of Elune are a group of priestesses devoted to the goddess Elune. The Druids are protectors of nature, spending much of their time in a trance in the Emerald Dream.\r\n\r\nThe Night Elves have enjoyed a close relationship with the Wild Gods and Dragonflights. Cenarius blessed the early Night Elves, appreciative of their curiosity for nature. After the Sundering, the Dragonflights blessed the Night Elves and planted the first World Tree, Nordrassil.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read more about the history of the Night Elves, check out our summary of their lore: World of Warcraft Chronicle: Night Elves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPandaren\r\npandaren.pngOverview: Couched in myth and legend, rarely seen and even more rarely understood, the enigmatic pandaren have long been a mystery to the other races of Azeroth.

The noble history of the pandaren people stretches back thousands of years, well before the empires of man and before even the sundering of the world.\r\n\r\nDenizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren once labored under the oppressive thumb of a monstrous race of ancient warlords known as the Mogu. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, the pandaren staged a successful revolution that deposed the Mogu and established a pandaren empire that would prosper for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nDuring the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when demons flooded onto Azeroth and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the last Emperor of the pandaren discovered a way to protect his land from the devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left Pandaria haunted ever since...\r\n\r\nPandaren are unique in that players go through the starting zone, The Wandering Isle, neutral. The events in the starting zone will then force them to pick a side, permanently aligning themselves with either the Alliance or the Horde. Once a side is taken, Pandaren across factions can still communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nCapital City: The Pandaren have two capital cities located in Vale of Eternal Blossoms: Shrine of Seven Stars and Shrine of Two Moons. These cities are lavish, covered in precious stones and gold carvings, to show the vibrant Pandaren culture.\r\n\r\nZones: Pandaren begin on The Wandering Isle. Life on the Wandering Isle is pacific and enlightening until the day the Wandering Isle travels through the seas near Azeroth\u2019s Maelstrom. The ground becomes unstable, crops wilt, and Shen-zin Su seems to wobble in the ocean, drifting in an unsteady pattern that may be a death spiral. The entire continent of Pandaria is also dedicated to the culture of the Pandaren: Kun-Lai Summit, Townlong Steppes, The Jade Forest, Krasarang Wilds, Valley of the Four Winds, Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Timeless Isle.\r\n\r\nClasses: Hunter Hunter, Mage Mage, Monk Monk, Priest Priest, Rogue Rogue, Shaman Shaman, Warrior Warrior.

You can find inhabitants of Pandaria creating brews all over the continent, notably Stormstout Brewery.\r\n\r\nAfter the Mogu Empire dissolved, the Zandalari wanted to claim the land promised to them by Lei Shen - northern Kun-Lai Summit. The Pandaren, who felt no need to maintain a military, were badly outmatched until a young Pandaren, Jiang, defeated the Zandalari while fighting on a trained cloud serpent. Desperate, the Zandalari sought to resurrect Lei Shen, but Jiang sacrificed herself, killing the troll leader Mengai in the process. Jiang\u2019s legacy was honored by preserving her teachings and passing them down in the Order of the Cloud Serpent. Players can gain reputation with Order of the Cloud Serpent to learn how to ride cloud serpents like Reins of the Golden Cloud Serpent Reins of the Golden Cloud Serpent. For this reputation grind, you help raise a hatchling to maturity and compete in races with other cloud serpent riders. This faction rewards jewelcrafting panther patterns, capturable wild serpent battle pets, pet toys, and cloud serpent mounts.\r\n\r\nBack in the days of captivity, Kang, a young brewmaster, realized that the Mogu\u2019s cruelty was a sign of weakness, not strength. Without servants, they were nothing. As the Pandaren were forbidden weapons, he taught himself how to fight unarmed with a unique \u201cdancing\u201d style relying on inner strength. lave rebellions started and the Mogu quickly crumbled without slaves to rely upon. In the final battle, both sides sustained serious losses, including Kang. This incited some Pandaren to turn to revenge, but Kang\u2019s pupil Song reminded Pandaren about their pursuit for justice. Song became the first \u201clorewalker,\u201d traveling around Pandaria to spread parables about their culture. The unique \u201cdancing\u201d style can be seen in the martial arts animations of the Monk class in combat. The Pandaren's values of peace and inner strength are reflected in their tranquil landscapes, Tian Monastery in The Jade Forest, and Peak of Serenity.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read more about the history of the Pandaren, check out our summary of their lore: World of Warcraft Chronicle: Pandaren.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorgen\r\nworgen.pngOverview: The Worgen are a cursed race comprised of the people of Gilneas who have been afflicted by an ancient druidic curse, causing them to transform into deadly half-worg half-men.

Create your character's appearance in Wowhead's Dressing Room.\r\n\r\nCulture: Worgen cities and dress are reminiscent of an English novel--very rainy, antique, and gloomy.\r\n\r\nThe Worgen have clues ties to the Night Elves; a group of Night Elves millenia ago decided to harness the power of the Wild God Goldrinn, but couldn't control their raw power. Scythe of Elune Scythe of Elune was originally created to harness the rage of Goldrinn by pairing Goldrinn's fang with a staff blessed by Elune. This failed, and the worgen were banished to the Emerald Dream.\r\n\r\nYears later, Velinde Starsong found and used the Scythe to fight demons in Felwood, but could not control the summoned Worgen. When traveling to Silverpine Forest to ask Arugal for help, she was attacked by Worgen and killed. The power of the Scythe then summoned even more Worgen into Duskwood from the Emerald Dream. This was a questline in vanilla which is no longer available. In Take Back What's Ours Take Back What's Ours, players must retrieve the Scythe before the Forsaken acquire it and use it to control the Worgen.\r\n\r\nThe Greymane worgen were infected after the curse spread to Gilneas. The night elves helped them find a cure to retain their sanity and refuge; the Worgen \"hub\" is now in Darnassus.\r\n\r\n\r\nLightforged Draenei\r\nOverview: The Lightforged Draenei Lightforged Draenei are a group of draenei that are part of the Army of the Light.

They are considered strong survivors of many hardships. Blood elves as a race deal with an addiction to arcane energy, and their lives often have to do with resisting its power.\r\n\r\nGoblin\r\ngoblins.pngOverview: After series of cataclysmic events in the Lost Isles and the Undermine, a betrayal from one of their own trade princes, and open hostility from members of the Alliance, the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel decide that their relations with the Horde can no longer be neutral.

The noble history of the pandaren people stretches back thousands of years, well before the empires of man and before even the sundering of the world.\r\n\r\nDenizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren once labored under the oppressive thumb of a monstrous race of ancient warlords known as the Mogu.

As the Pandaren were forbidden weapons, he taught himself how to fight unarmed with a unique \u201cdancing\u201d style relying on inner strength. lave rebellions started and the Mogu quickly crumbled without slaves to rely upon. In the final battle, both sides sustained serious losses, including Kang. This incited some Pandaren to turn to revenge, but Kang\u2019s pupil Song reminded Pandaren about their pursuit for justice. Song became the first \u201clorewalker,\u201d traveling around Pandaria to spread parables about their culture.

After the adventurers and the forces from outside the Broken Isles stopped the Drogbar uprising and reclaimed the hammer, and later on stopped the Burning Legion, the Highmountain Tauren Highmountain Tauren pledged their allegiance to the Horde and joined to fight alongside their tauren kin.\r\n\r\nRacial Leader(s): The racial leader is Mayla Highmountain; alonigside her are Jale Rivermane and Lasan Skyhorn\r\n\r\nCapital: Thunder Totem\r\n\r\nClasses: Druid, Hunter, Monk, Shaman, Warrior\r\n\r\nMount: The Highmountain Tauren Highmountain Tauren Allied Race mount is the Highmountain Thunderhoof Highmountain Thunderhoof\r\n\r\nRacials:  Bull Rush,  Pride of Ironhorn,  Mountaineer,  Rugged Tenacity,  Waste Not, Want Not\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to learn more about this faction, check Wowhead's guide to the Highmountain Tauren Allied Race.\r\nMag'har Orc\r\nOverview: The Mag'har Orcs are a clan of Orcs from Draenor. For untold generations, the orc clans of Draenor battled one another in endless war. But when Gul'dan offered them the blood of his demonic masters, the disparate tribes of Mag'har - the orcish word for \"uncorrupted\" - refused the dark bargain and banded together to drive out the Burning Legion. In the aftermath of the fall of Hellfire Citadel, the Mag'har pledged to one day repay Azeroth's heroes for aiding their cause. As war against the Alliance intensifies, the Horde called upon the might of the Mag'har to seize victory.\r\n\r\nRacial Leader: The racial leader is Greatmother Geyah\r\n\r\nCapital: Orgrimmar\r\n\r\nClasses: Hunter, Mage, Monk, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warrior\r\n\r\nMount: The Mag'har Orc Mag'har Orc Allied Race mount is the Mag'har Direwolf Mag'har Direwolf\r\n\r\nRacials:  Ancestral Call,  Open Skies,  Savage Blood,  Sympathetic Vigor\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to learn more about this faction, check Wowhead's guide to the Mag'har Orc Allied Race.\r\nZandalari Troll\r\nOverview: The Zandalari Trolls were and still are the most powerful tribe of trolls who settled in Zandalar.

There are unique perks, mounts, and pets that you can only get being part of a Guild too!\r\n\r\nThis guide covers how to gain reputation with a guild, how to level a guild up, achievements, perks for each guild level, and what reputation levels and achievements you need to unlock all the special guild rewards.\r\nGuild Reputation\r\nGuild reputation lets players purchase special rewards from Guild Vendors and work towards Guild Achievements.\r\nGuild reputation can be gained by turning in quests, killing PvE bosses in a guild group, or PvPing in a guild group.\r\nIn Mists of Pandaria, the weekly cap for guild reputation you can earn per week has been removed. Between this and the limit on daily quests being lifted, you can grind reputation out pretty quickly.\r\nYou can speed up reputation gains through reputation buffs like  Diplomacy (full list here).\r\nThere are two guild tabards that increase reputation: Illustrious Guild Tabard Illustrious Guild Tabard requires Friendly and boosts guild rep gains by 50%, Renowned Guild Tabard Renowned Guild Tabard requires Honored and boosts guild rep gains by 100%.\r\nWhen you join a new guild, you lose one rank of reputation. So if you were Exalted with your old guild, you'll be Revered with your new guild.\r\nGuild Leveling\r\nGuild levels have been removed in Warlords of Draenor--all guilds are effectively level 25. Players can still increase personal reputation in their guild, and complete activities that reward gold for the guild bank.\r\n\r\nActivities that grant reputation:\r\nQuests and daily quests that grant player experience.\r\nScenario: 3 guild members present\r\nDungeon: 3 guild members for 50%, 4 guild members for 100%, 5 guild members for 125%. More experience for heroic dungeons.\r\n10 player Raid: 8 guild members. More experience for heroic raid.\r\nRated Battleground: 8 guild members\r\n25 player Raid: 20 guild members. More experience for heroic raid.\r\nOld Raids: 10 guild members\r\nThere are also several types of Guild Challenges which award gold:\r\nGuild Dungeon Challenge: 7 total per week, 250 for each.\r\nGuild Scenario Challenge: 15 total per week, 250 for each.\r\nGuild Challenge Mode Dungeon Challenge: 3 total per week, 500 for each.\r\nGuild Raid Challenge: 1 total per week, 1,000 for each.\r\nGuild Rated Battleground Challenge: 3 total per week, 500 for each.\r\nGuild Rewards\r\nThese rewards are sold by Guild Vendors. These vendors are found in all major cities.\r\n\r\nWarlords of Draenor adds a new mount, pet, and guild banners from achievements.\r\n\r\nA few notes about interesting vanity items:\r\nThe guild shirts aded in Mists of Pandaria incorporate the guild logo and come in a variety of styles. To learn more about shirt styles, check out our guide to shirts.\r\nGuild battle pets are not cageable.\r\nYou can transmog your capes to look like guild capes in Mists of Pandaria.\r\nReins of the Thundering Jade Cloud Serpent Reins of the Thundering Jade Cloud Serpent requires level 85 and  Artisan Riding to learn after purchasing it at Exalted.

This isn\u2019t easy, but, you\u2019ll have about the best gear possible on a level 20.\r\n\r\nDesired end state, Gnomish Engineer and any other profession. Enchanting is the first and last to choose as it requires you to disenchant a lot of BfA gear to get the enchants that actually work for your gear. Since you can make vellums, there\u2019s no need to keep enchanting after making a handful of vellums for gear you might obtain later. Getting enough mats to make the better BfA enchants will take time, so, for a while, you\u2019ll have Engineering/Enchanting. To make some of the cool engineering devices, you need other items from gathering or crafting professions. For some of the fun trinkets, you need the Inlaid Mithril Cylinder. In order to get that, you need to pick up mining, level engineering to 205 to make the plans, drop mining and level blacksmithing to 200 to make the Mithril Cylinder, then drop blacksmithing to pick up another profession.\r\n\r\nGetting some of the items out of the way that you\u2019ll need later from a gathering skill and banking it saves frustration.\r\nBags\r\nThe largest bag you can purchase is the 18 slot Explorer's Pack Explorer's Pack. You\u2019ll need 11 of them to fill up your bank and backpack. You can get the 28 slot Goat's Tote Goat's Tote from a rare in BfA (100% drop rate). You can get a 26 slot bag, Addie's Ink-Stained Satchel Addie's Ink-Stained Satchel in Legion. A 24 slot bag, Grummlepack Grummlepack is available in Pandaria. Your priority will be on the backpack since you\u2019ll be gathering a ton of mats, and saving every item that you can disenchant later. Buy the reagent slot in your bank early! The Big Bag Guide. To get the best enchants for your F2P account, you'll need to level BfA tailoring to get the enchanting mats. If you do this, at tailoring 50, you can make the 30 slot Deep Sea Bag Deep Sea Bag.\r\nPrep statement\r\nSome engineering items will require a lot of farming mobs to get the required items - or gems which require a lot of mining. Be prepared to drop professions and relevel them again. Between profession swaps, consider picking up enchanting so you can disenchant the gear you obtained while farming mats.\r\n\r\nAt level 20 with mostly item level 61 gear, you probably won\u2019t need to keep alchemy. Most of the alchemy and enchanting recipes won\u2019t work on gear with an item level over 50. Many of the newer Shadowlands recipes require your character to be level 50.\r\nStarting out\r\nGetting to level 20 first before leveling professions is easier with the faster mount speed obtained at level 20. Even though many of the mobs now scale, being reasonably geared will make gathering quicker.\r\n\r\nWhen you first create your character, pick up Enchanting and Tailoring, make your Runed Copper Rod and disenchant anything you don\u2019t use. If you have heirloom gear, use it. Try to quest in Kul Tiras/Zandalar once you\u2019re able and pick up BfA Tailoring as it increases the drop rate of cloth from humanoids. Cloth gear will get scrapped, keep anything else to DE as that is the enchanting that you need to finish up your toon. Don\u2019t spend time leveling enchanting at this point - just disenchant non-BfA items and bank what you can. Avoid disenchanting BfA items as you can use these for easy skillups later. You can use the Scrap-O-Matic 1000 to determine which gear is from BfA.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Enchanting\r\nWhat is important to you?\r\nGyrofreeze Ice Reflector Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector (Alchemy)\r\nCatseye Ultra Goggles Catseye Ultra Goggles (Alchemy)\r\nIce Deflector Ice Deflector (Alchemy), Go for the trinket rather than this\r\nGnomish Death Ray Gnomish Death Ray (Blacksmithing)\r\nGnomish Battle Chicken Gnomish Battle Chicken (Blacksmithing)\r\nArcane Bomb Arcane Bomb (Alchemy, Blacksmithing)\r\nVoice Amplification Modulator Voice Amplification Modulator (Alchemy, Blacksmithing), limited usefulness\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve hit 20, run a few dungeons to get some level 61 gear as it makes gathering much easier.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4108, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fef18cc-ad85-41f4-b1f3-2cd815837a08": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fef18cc-ad85-41f4-b1f3-2cd815837a08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00e44558-2a4e-489a-87c6-4b878778cfde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6146ac93973b27356909381354e55394493473358b4aca27089562bd4e856950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5719529e-eaaa-4c97-acc7-eec4acf287da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "edc309e8939ca28dc7b36c1034475c38f5aebbb664565345b567178af4ce48af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "048660d6-c3e6-4874-914e-2144bea2dcd3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a053396880f83144a654342c698cdf444afe35280e4360d5bd50fea269db75a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Avoid disenchanting BfA items as you can use these for easy skillups later.

At this point, you can start to hold your own in battlegrounds. You will be targeted first, but unless people are in Heirlooms, you are pretty evenly matched with someone 4-5 levels above you. Remember that you'll probably want to use Chromie Time to switch to classic for your Shoulders and Chest and possibly the helm. For the helm, you can do The Great Sea Scrolls The Great Sea Scrolls and turn it in AFTER you hit level 20 to get the level 61 helm. It requires you to loot 12-15 chests throughout Kul Tiras or Zandalar for the scrolls, and quest turnins are on the respective continents for Horde and Alliance.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Enchanting, Tailoring\r\n\r\nPick up Tailoring and make 20 Relic of the Past I Relic of the Past I. There are recipes that need these if you want a slightly higher itemlevel. These are really easy to make using Linen Cloth and you can make them at Level 1, so make 20 of them, just in case. You can also wait until you pick up Blacksmithing and make these at the cost of 5 copper ore per. You will get skillups, so this can help level Classic Blacksmithing. With BfA Tailoring, you can make some of the  Relic of the Past III combined with Tidespray Linen Bracers Tidespray Linen Bracers which increases the chance when scrapping to get Deep Sea Satin Deep Sea Satin.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Enchanting, Skinning\r\n\r\nDrop tailoring and pick up Skinning. At level 20, you need to have Skinning around 100 to start getting Medium Leather (Un\u2019Goro Crater). At 150 skill, you can skin to get Heavy Leather (Desolace). You need 17 Medium Leather and 8 Heavy leather.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Mining, Engineering, then drop Engineering for Jewelcrafting\r\n\r\nIt is strongly recommended that you keep Mining and Jewelcrafting at the same time due to the discovery and proc rate of getting the gems you need. Once you run enough instances, you\u2019ll end up with Item Level 61 gear - some of which has sockets. Pandaria enchanting has the +2 primary stat gems. Due to the proc rate of getting the gems you need, this is a good time to have Mining/Jewelcrafting as your two professions. Since you are going after Pandarian gems, get Pandarian Engineering and make the Mist-Piercing Goggles Mist-Piercing Goggles. While you\u2019re at it, take a few minutes to pick up Draenor Mining and Engineering and make the Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife. Drop Engineering and pick up Pandarian Jewelcrafting. Make 10-20 of the gems that you\u2019ll want and then drop Jewelcrafting. If you PVP a lot, make a bunch of the +stamina gems in addition to your primary stat gems. Don\u2019t spend time doing Classic Mining at this point even if you are going for the Arcane Bombs.\r\n\r\nPandarian Mining routes. You can mine only Ghost Iron Ore Ghost Iron Ore and it works fine. You can also mine Kyparite Kyparite in an area with mobs that are level 25 and not too difficult to handle. I did not find the increased drop rate of gems faster than mining more Ghost Iron.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMost likely you\u2019ll want to focus on the Primordial Ruby recipes ( Bold Primordial Ruby,  Brilliant Primordial Ruby,  Delicate Primordial Ruby,  Flashing Primordial Ruby,  Precise Primordial Ruby) and the Solid River's Heart Solid River's Heart for the +2 Stamina.

Bear in mind that the tooltip says +4, but at level 20, you only get +2. Depending on your luck, you need 25 Jewelcrafting to learn the Facet of Research for Primordial Rubies, and each 100 Ghost Iron Ore gives you roughly 3 Primordial Rubies for the research. As it would take 7 days at worst to get all of the red recipes, you might need 700 Ghost Iron Ore. Due to scaling, it isn't necessary to get the Primordial Ruby Recipes as Perfect Pandarian gems give you the same +2 primary stat as the Primordial Rubies. While the Perfect Pandarian gems require cutting a number of gems, between the two, you can make a decent set of gems for the future. The normal cuts give you +1, except for the +1 primary/+1 secondary gems. If you kill enough rares, you can get the Primal Diamond recipe which gives you the ability to make a Fleet Primal Diamond (another world drop) which gives +speed and stacks with the next gem. The Kul Tiran/Zandalar gems require itemlevel 50 - and you'll have plenty of itemlevel 61 gear. One interesting gem is Straddling Viridium Straddling Viridium which is Unique Equipped and results in +8 at level 20, or roughly 7% run speed.\r\n\r\nDepending on how much instancing you do, you do have the chance to get an epic itemlevel 87 in instances. If you get lucky enough to get an epic drop like that with a socket, you can use Shadowlands gems which require itemlevel 87. If you intend to instance frequently, you might want to make a few of the Jewel Clusters. You can always drop something and mine to get Shadowland gems as the interesting gems are not discoveries and can be learned fairly early on.\r\nDecision time.\r\nI need the Arcane Bomb Arcane Bomb! (or Catseye Ultra Goggles or Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector) Bear in mind the Arcane Bomb is a world drop and might take time. If you intend to make them, making the Arcanite bars while you have Alchemy saves you from having to level alchemy later to make the bars when you don\u2019t have Herbalism and Alchemy at the same time.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Herbalism, Alchemy\r\n\r\nIf you want the Arcane Bomb Arcane Bomb - which in the 20-29 bracket is about \u2153 of a player\u2019s mana, you need Alchemy. If you are going after Alchemy, drop your current professions and pick up Herbalism/Alchemy. Level alchemy to 275 so you can transmute Thorium into Arcanite. You\u2019ll want to make a lot of Arcanite Bars (Thorium). For the Catseye Ultra Googles and Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector, you also need Catseye Elixir Catseye Elixir and Frost Oil Frost Oil. Since you\u2019re a level 20 in a bracket with level 29s, the Catseye Ultra Goggles help quite a bit. It looks like the drop rate for the Arcane Bomb is limited to instances you would need to join with someone with a paid account.\r\n\r\nFor engineering you\u2019ll need to collect 40 Purple Lotus and 24 Nagrand Arrowbloom and 4 Icecap. Pick some extra, just in case.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Mining, Alchemy\r\n\r\nDrop Herbalism and pick up Mining so that you can make a handful of the Arcanite Bar Arcanite Bar. Keep the ore as you\u2019ll need it for Engineering and Blacksmithing. Make note of the materials you\u2019ll need for Blacksmithing in the next section if you are going to do both.\r\n\r\nFor Thorium, Silithis (make sure you timewalk back to pre-Cataclysm) or Winterspring are the best locations for the Arcane Crystal Arcane Crystal.", "start_char_idx": 6682, "end_char_idx": 10639, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3281758-08a3-40ce-9eec-ed710cf78980": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3281758-08a3-40ce-9eec-ed710cf78980", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00e44558-2a4e-489a-87c6-4b878778cfde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6146ac93973b27356909381354e55394493473358b4aca27089562bd4e856950", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "048660d6-c3e6-4874-914e-2144bea2dcd3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a053396880f83144a654342c698cdf444afe35280e4360d5bd50fea269db75a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a25d5cee-f3d2-462d-b5aa-df82c6869cda", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b530017b44e7ba3b30a3d14aec16fce86e2c0052a7dab89b02b91da3aff15889", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It looks like the drop rate for the Arcane Bomb is limited to instances you would need to join with someone with a paid account.\r\n\r\nFor engineering you\u2019ll need to collect 40 Purple Lotus and 24 Nagrand Arrowbloom and 4 Icecap.

You can always relevel Alchemy to make more Arcanite bars later on. It wasn't until about mining 80 that Arcane Crystals started being looted for me.\r\nThe End Grind\r\nProfessions: Mining, Engineering\r\n\r\nIn order to get the Gnomish Death Ray, you need an Inlaid Mithril Cylinder Inlaid Mithril Cylinder. If you don\u2019t want this trinket, you can skip Blacksmithing which makes things a lot easier. In fact, you\u2019re not required to level Classic Engineering too quickly which saves a lot of time. The most useful items are tinkers that you can get relatively quickly. The trinkets are situationally useful and fun but aren\u2019t a must-have since the stats on these are much lower than trinkets gained through instancing.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got to have the Gnomish Death Ray Gnomish Death Ray!\r\n\r\nTo get the Gnomish Death Ray, you need the Inlaid Mithril Cylinder Inlaid Mithril Cylinder. To get that, you need to level Classic Engineering to 205 to create Plans: Inlaid Mithril Cylinder Plans: Inlaid Mithril Cylinder. You then need to level Classic Blacksmithing to level 200, learn the recipe, then create the Cylinder. With additional Inlaid Mithril Cylinders, you can make the Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan (1), Gnomish Battle Chicken (2), and the Firework Launcher (1 per Launcher). You might as well make at least four - more if you intend to make multiple Firework Launchers.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Blacksmithing, Engineering (you\u2019ll keep this permanently)\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve made the Inlaid Mithril Cylinders, you can drop Blacksmithing and pick up Mining again. Since you will want other Engineering items from other expansions, you will need to do more mining.\r\n\r\nBlacksmithing guide\r\n\r\n150x Rough Stone\r\n150x Copper Bar\r\n95x Coarse Stone\r\n5x Silver Bar\r\n140x Bronze Bar\r\n105x Heavy Stone\r\n5x Gold Bar\r\n230x Iron Bar\r\n35x Green Dye - Sold by Tailoring and Leatherworking supply vendors\r\n50x Steel Bar\r\n\r\nBefore you drop mining, if you intend to get the Arcanite bars, mine enough Thorium and Arcane Crystals. Remember that each Arcane Crystal (and the appropriate Thorium which you\u2019ll have plenty of) makes 3 Arcane Bombs.\r\n\r\nConsider if you want to level BfA Blacksmithing to create Monel-Hardened Hoofplates Monel-Hardened Hoofplates (50 Blacksmithing), which can later be converted by Enchanting to Light-Step Hoofplates Light-Step Hoofplates (165 Enchanting). It takes roughly 775 Monelite Ore to level Blacksmithing to make the Monel-Hardened Hoofplates Monel-Hardened Hoofplates.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Mining, Engineering\r\n\r\nIf you decide not to get the Gnomish Death Ray, you can go after various Engineering that makes the most sense. In order to get the Northrend Nitro Boosts, you need a Gyromatic Micro-Adjustor Gyromatic Micro-Adjustor which requires Classic Engineering 175\u2026 or, you could make a Draenor Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife at level 1. Focus on getting the Pandaria Goblin Glider and the Northrend Nitro Boosts as those are the most useful tinkers.

The Gravity Well comes in handy during some PVE questing - if you want to level Pandarian Farming or to turn in the Archaeology items in Pandaria.\r\n\r\nProfessions: Engineering/Enchanting\r\n\r\nAt this point, obtain Enchanting and level BfA enchanting until you get enough vellums to enchant your rings and weapons.\r\nFinal notes\r\nYou're mostly geared with the best items you can get. Hopefully you've run some battlegrounds and over time, as you level Engineering, you'll open up a few more trinkets that are fun. Farming for the Arcane Bomb recipe takes a bit but that is a huge surprise in 20-29 battlegrounds to the enemy players. Fine tuning, running instances to get the last few pieces of gear, starting to optimize your stat priority with replacement gear takes place and over time, you'll have your Best in Slot gear, with the best enchants you can get, and the best gems. Focus on having a PVP and Instancing set - having more stamina can make a difference in battlegrounds - and with the rest of your gear, you'll have the DPS output to hold your own.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!", "start_char_idx": 13293, "end_char_idx": 16333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "642efecf-c464-44a9-bad2-6b6ece59e6de": {"__data__": {"id_": "642efecf-c464-44a9-bad2-6b6ece59e6de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b5d0c10-0a63-4a3e-bc08-c1d061f11e0a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df3ff63f9d4e7aae7cb0087d60011afc78a4c797ab135b9402448a3bd4af153f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "53834b31-a6e2-4421-b86b-31a5a252c38b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "139d0717d8e8b9e163a2918a74af94d7391c2e265fa1500254f2710def9456eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Guild, Social Communication, World of Warcraft is an Massively Multiplayer Online game. Many of the activities in-game are enhanced by doing them with friends! From completing a quest together to finding four other players to complete a challenging dungeon for better loot, World of Warcraft is a social experience. This guide explains how to make the most of your social experience in WoW.\r\nTalking to Players\r\nYou can chat to players in game privately using whispers. All messages with players will show up by default at the bottom-left of your screen.\r\n\r\nTo whisper someone, hit the \"Return\" key, type \"/tell\" and then the name of the player. You can then type a message privately to that player. When you hit \"Return\" again, they will see the message. If you are already in a conversation with that person, you can just click on their name in the chat log and type your message back.\r\n\r\nYou can also communicate through says or yells. Avoid yelling because everyone in the zone will hear you. Whispers display as light pink, says are white, and yells are red.\r\nhello.png\r\nEmotes\r\nAnother way of communicating with players is emotes. Instead of typing a sentence, you can type in a phrase and your in-game character will express that feeling through an animation and sound byte. For example, /cheer will have your character jump in the air and sound happy.\r\n\r\nThis sort of interaction is not private like whispers; nearby players can see your emotes (and decide to join in). Emotes are also required for some fun achievements, like To All The Squirrels I've Loved Before To All The Squirrels I've Loved Before.\r\n\r\nSome popular emotes include: /bow, /greet, /highfive, /cheer, /silly, /smile\r\nemote message.png\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous emotes and Wowhead user Ozlem has made a series of guides highlighting each type of emote:\r\nHappy, Polite, Friendly & Affectionate Emotes.\r\nNeutral, Unhappy & Despondent Emotes.\r\nTaunts, Hostile & Combat Emotes.\r\nReactions, Miscellaneous & Custom Emotes.\r\nCreating A Party\r\nYou can form a party of up to 5 players in game. Parties are good if you need help completing an objective or need to meet up with a player:\r\nIf you are interested in running a dungeon and need a few more players, your party can queue up as a group.\r\nYou can see the location of other party members on the map.\r\nBy typing /party you can talk only to your group members. This chat will be light blue.\r\nTo form a party, either right-click on a player and hit the Invite option, or type /invite <playername> into chat. Only the leader of a party can invite.\r\nparty message.png\r\nChat Channels and Tabs\r\nYou can join public chat channels in various zones, or set up a group chat with your friends in-game.\r\n\r\nTo join a channel, type \"/join <name>.\" You will either join an existing channel with that name, or if there is no channel, start a new channel. Text from this channel will be in beige.\r\n\r\nThe default chat channels are:\r\nGeneral\r\nTrade\r\nLocalDefense\r\nLookingForGroup\r\nTo leave a channel, type \"/leave <name>\"\r\n\r\nTo manage the chat channels click the icon in the chat below \"Social\". You can see who belongs to each general channel, and hit the \"Add\" button to create your own chat channel. It can even be password protected.\r\nchatmessage.png\r\nPlayer Interactions\r\nWhen you right-click on a player's name, a menu pops up with a number of options. Here's an overview.\r\nInvite: invite a player to your party\r\nWhisper: Lets you privately message a player\r\nInspect: Open up a character's gear profile so you can check out their gear\r\nCompare Achievements: See how many in-game accomplishments you both have\r\nTrade: Open a window with another player to give or receive items and gold\r\nFollow: Need to step away from your computer for a minute? Put a friend on auto-follow if they are going to the same place\r\nDuel: See which player is stronger in combat\r\nPet-Battle Duel: If you decide to collect pets later in the game, you can challenge a player's team of pets to combat\r\nFriends List\r\nIf you enjoy interacting with someone, you can add them as a friend. The next time both of you are in-game at the same time, you can easily get in touch and plan something to do.\r\n\r\nYou can add someone to your friends list two ways: via their character name, or their Battle.net name.\r\nIf you add someone\u2019s character name, you are only notified when that particular character logs onto WoW.\r\nIf you add someone\u2019s Battle.tag, you'll know when they're online on any World of Warcraft character, or playing any other Blizzard game.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4525, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53834b31-a6e2-4421-b86b-31a5a252c38b": {"__data__": {"id_": "53834b31-a6e2-4421-b86b-31a5a252c38b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b5d0c10-0a63-4a3e-bc08-c1d061f11e0a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df3ff63f9d4e7aae7cb0087d60011afc78a4c797ab135b9402448a3bd4af153f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "642efecf-c464-44a9-bad2-6b6ece59e6de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bcb967ccacaa308dcd3342ce22027194ce41c38229fae71a00564c70e6903719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1e5891f-b651-4960-9b9d-707470159d20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01fd1000cc018246245d8ab90140ac1f05217b1e926e0604012ad73984db8e5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Put a friend on auto-follow if they are going to the same place\r\nDuel: See which player is stronger in combat\r\nPet-Battle Duel: If you decide to collect pets later in the game, you can challenge a player's team of pets to combat\r\nFriends List\r\nIf you enjoy interacting with someone, you can add them as a friend.

Be polite and ask first before doing so!\r\nSee what Blizzard games all of your Battletag friends are playing.\r\nThe Pending tab shows all of your own friend requests.\r\nThe speech bubble option at the top right allows you to set a status message. Looking for help? Set a status message asking for assistance and see if any friends reply.\r\nSet your status to available (green), yellow (away), or red (busy), using the dropdown menu at the top right.\r\nRight-click on a friend's name to bring up more options, such as setting a note so you remember details about your new friend, and viewing their friends so you can see if you share any acquaintances.\r\nThe ignore tab brings up all of the players you have muted. You will not see messages from these people.\r\nYour Friends LIst comes with several other tabs:\r\nThe \"Who\" tab lets you query the names of players in a certain zone or guild. This is helpful if you are looking for assistance in an area, or want to join a guild and need to speak to an officer.\r\nThe chat tab brings up a list of chat channels you belong to, which is discussed below in more detail. There are several default ones you can belong to, like Trade Chat in a city, and you can also create your own custom channels to have small group conversations with friends.\r\nThe Raid tab is inactive unless you join a very large group at higher levels.\r\nIf you play other Blizzard games, you may be interested in setting up a Battletag and using the Battle.net-wide friends list. Here is a link to get the Battle.net App.\r\nSingle Sign-On: Log in once to access Blizzard games, and stay logged in for up to 30 days.\r\n\r\nInstall and Auto-Update Games: Install games directly through the app and, if you choose to leave the app running on your desktop, keep them up-to-date automatically even while you\u2019re away from your computer.\r\n\r\nGet the Latest News: The app serves as a central hub to find the latest Blizzard game information, developer blogs, and more. Filter news based on which games you play, and get breaking updates before you enter Azeroth, Sanctuary, or the Koprulu sector.\r\nOn the Battle.net App, you can see which of your friends is playing any Blizzard game. You can even message them if they're not playing the same game.\r\n\r\nWhen you sign up for the Battle.net App, you will be prompted to create a Battle.tag. This is a name that your friends will see when you play any game. If a friend has a Battletag, they can tell when you play any character in WoW, not just one with a specific name.\r\n\r\nFrom Blizzard's Battletag blog:\r\nA BattleTag\u2122 is a player-chosen nickname that identifies your Battle.net account in our games, websites, community forums, and more. Only one BattleTag can be associated with a Battle.net account.\r\n\r\nBattleTag friends are not available cross-region. You must add friends to each region\u2019s friend list when you log in for the first time.\r\n\r\nBattleTags do not need to be unique. You can use any name you want, as long as it follows our Naming Policy. Each BattleTag is assigned a numeric ID to create a unique identifier (for example, FallenSlayer#3592).\r\n\r\nTo change your BattleTag, log in to Battle.net Account Management, go to the Summary page, and click Change in the BattleTag section.\r\nGuild Information\r\nThe best way to ensure you are surrounded by like-minded friendly players is to find a guild which suits your needs.

A guild is an extended social network, where you can easily talk to other members and see who is available online. Members of your guild can help you with group challenges, items to wear, and general assistance.\r\nguild finder.png\r\n\r\n\r\nAs your guild completes milestones together, you can even purchase special rewards like Reins of the Dark Phoenix Reins of the Dark Phoenix and Reins of the Thundering Jade Cloud Serpent Reins of the Thundering Jade Cloud Serpent. Learn more in our Guild Rewards Guide.\r\n\r\nFinding the right guild is important. Some players may spam you with guild invites when they see you are unguilded. You don't have to accept the first guild you find! Here are some ways to find a good guild:\r\nUse Blizzard's in-game Guid Finder tool. To open this tool up, hit \"J\" in game.\r\nOn the Guild Finder page, you will be prompted to fill in some information about your playstyle:\r\nGuild Interests: Questing (leveling), Dungeons (group content), Raids (higher-level group content), PvP, and Role Playing\r\nAvailability: Weekdays and/or Weekends\r\nClass Roles: Tank, Healer, or Damage.\r\nYou can also leave any additional comments.\r\nOnce you have submitted a guild query, interested guilds can leave invitations in the Requests tab in the Guild Finder.\r\nYou can see a list of guilds in the \"Browse\" tab. Mouse over each guild to see their interests and number of members online. While it's better to do more guild research before asking to join, you can hit \"Request Membership\" if it looks like a good fit.\r\nYou can also check the Guild Recruitment Forums on the official World of Warcraft site, or read channels like the Guild Recruitment Channel in game.\r\nIf you find a guild that seems interesting, check out their website and try to talk members of the guild, either online or on their website.\r\nTo get an invitation to a guild, log online and message the officer of a guild for an invite. It is poor etiquette to message about an invite before speaking to an officer. You may be ignored.\r\nThere are many types of guilds, here are a few things to keep in mind so you find one that's a good fit:\r\nActive users: Find a guild that has lots of players who enjoy logging on frequently!\r\nSize: Some players prefer a guild with a handful of players they can know personally, others want to be part of a larger community where there's always someone online to help out.\r\nActivities: Guilds specialize in different things, based on the interests of the officers. Some guilds are designed to be social or help other players level. Other guilds focus on advanced max-level activities, such as raiding.\r\nReputation: Similar to real-life organizations, guilds build up their reputation based on the actions of their users. Look for guilds that are friendly and are known for being stable and reliable.\r\nOnce you are part of a guild, be courteous and helpful! You will see guild chat appear in your chat box in green text. You can send message to everyone in guild by typing /g <message>.", "start_char_idx": 7618, "end_char_idx": 11300, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fdca657-454e-4dbd-b4a6-12de0f6a3477": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fdca657-454e-4dbd-b4a6-12de0f6a3477", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4abc573e-bddb-4779-86b4-8b918677b398", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9af6eba80be9bf1a541524a20a4b61cf2e3b36a074249dddf7f574454609a69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "64dbab7b-e109-4383-892d-8664ce37fe8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9cb5b091d40aa2c446c119e6a2e17dfed0363a5fd8e062feb91ea278bb82d00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "General, Glossary, Term\tMeaning\r\nAggro\tAkin to threat, \"aggro\" refers to the moment when threat reaches the threshold necessary for the mob to attack you.\r\nAlts\tThis stands for \"alternate,\" as in alternate characters. People who have more than one character call their main one a \"main\" and any alternate characters \"alts.\"\r\nBC\tBurning Crusade (expansion).\r\nBurning Legion\tLead by fallen titan Sargeras, the Burning Legion is the evil force (think demons) behind Burning Crusade and Legion in particular, but also features heavily in Warlords of Draenor and to a much smaller extent WotLK.\r\nBelf\tBlood elf\r\nBubble hearth\tAn enchantment on bracers that allows hearthing while invulnerable.\r\nCata\tCataclysm (expansion).\r\nClassic\tThe re-release of the original World of Warcraft game before the first expansion Burning Crusade (as distinct from \"Vanilla,\" which Classic emulates).\r\nClothie\tA character that wears cloth; mages, priests, warlocks, and so forth.\r\nCloset\tA warlock can summon party members with what is called a warlock closet.\r\nCooldown\tWhen you use a spell it is then said to be \u201con cooldown\u201d until you can use it again. You can set the game to show a number in the spell's box counting down until it's available.\r\nCow\tA semi-derogatory, semi-affectionate term for tauren of any stripe. Indeed, all tauren can type /moo to actually moo.\r\nDon't Stand In The Fire!\tStop killing yourself ... usually by standing in fire or some other vile substance on the ground.\r\nDrinking\tChances are, the person is not sharing their inebriation status with you if they say this during combat; rather, they are drinking a potion so they can get more mana to heal your butt.\r\nDOT\tDamage Over Time. These spells and effects do damage every second.\r\nDPS\tDamage Per Second.\r\nEFC\t\"Enemy carrier of YOUR flag,\" not the flag carrier of the enemy's flag.\r\nFP\tFlight path.\r\nHearth\tTo use your hearthstone.\r\nHero class\tThere are technically two hero classes, which were actual new races with their own class. The first were Death Knights that came as part of the assault on the former master the Lich King, and the second hero class appeared with Legion, the Illidari, who were followers of Illidan in his battle to fight the Burning Legion and keep them from taking Azeroth and destroying it. You need a character of at least 55 to be able to start a DK and you need a level 98 character to be able to start an Illidari. In any case, the term isn't used for that massive body of land that no longer exists anymore, so confusion potential is naught.\r\nHOT\tHeal over time. These spells heal you for a bit each second.\r\nHPS\tHealing Per Second.\r\nKalimdor\t\u201cFor Kalimdor!\u201d is akin to \"For Pangea!\" only we didn't live on Pangea as a race, whereas all but orcs did live on the pre-sundering continent of Kalimdor. The west-most continent retained the name after The Sundering.\r\nKhaz Modan\tThe dwarves often refer to this location, but it's not one per se, it's a region including Aerie Peaks north to Grim Batol, west to Wetlands, east to Twilight Highlands, and south to Loch Modan.\r\nLegion\tExpansion (as distinct from the Burning Legion demonic forces).\r\nLFG\tLooking for group.\r\nLFM\tLooking for more.\r\nLordaeron\tA region encompassing Tirisfal Glades, Eastern and Western Plaguelands (before the plague), Silverpine Forest, Gilneas, Dalaran (when it was in the ground it was in Hillsbarad Foothills), Hillsbarad Foothills itself, and Arathi Highlands.\r\nLOS\t\"Line of sight.\" If there is a wall between you and your healer, you can't be healed. If there is a wall between you and your enemy, you can't cast most spells on it because they are out of sight.\r\nMain\tYour currently focused character that you play constantly or a character you cherish above all others.\r\nMob/Mobs\tEnemy or enemies.

Verb usage: \"This trinket procs Timewalk.\" Use X trinket to proc whatever proc.\" Yes, you see that you can confusingly use \"proc\" as the verb and a noun, but what it means is \" Use trinket X to activate Y effect, and that actually does make sense.\r\nQuel-Thalas\tA region including Ghostlands, Eversong Woods, Silvermoon City, the nearby Blood Elf starter zone, and the Isle of Quel-Danas. Also refers to an unused zone that at some point may be folded into the Plaguelands, somehow, because it is and remains an unfinished zone accessible only via traveling east on the northern coast of Tirisfal Glades. Because the zone is so small and because Stratholme used to be a port city, chances are that region may go to that city at some point, as it wasn't large enough for what they wanted to do with it as was evident when they didn't use the zone but instead started over with the other zones that are now considered part of what was Quel-Thalas before WotLK.\r\nRoll\tAs in \"I want to roll a priest.\" In Dungeons & Dragons as well as other genuine role-playing games in which you had to roll dice to determine your traits, these dice that are absolutely not used in WoW are what is being referred to. In early video game RPGs, you would still have to click a Roll button to roll your stats, and could roll over and over again until you got lucky and got a good roll. This is not the case in WoW, so people who say this are just trying to sound \"old school.\"\r\nRotation\tThe buttons that you press in combat.

Basically, a culmination of all the things I wish I had known when I first started to play WoW.\r\nPlanning Your Character\r\nWhen you start a new character, there are several decisions to make surrounding the direction in which you want to take it.\r\nClass\r\nTip: You can change everything about your character later (by paying a fee), but you cannot change your class. So, this is probably the most important decision you'll make.\r\nThe class you select depends entirely on which role you want to perform. In a \"battle\" situation, these are the three roles to fill for everyone to survive--tank, healer, and damage dealers:\r\nRole\tPurpose\r\nHealer\tHeals the hurt, especially the tank (if the tank dies, everyone dies).\r\nTank\tFocuses the mob on them, grabbing their attention using well-timed aggro methods and sustaining the majority of the damage.\r\nDamage Dealer\tDamages the mob, delivering it either through melee (in-your-face fighting) or casting (sending spells from a distance). The damage, regardless of its delivery method, can can either be immediate or \"damage over time\" (otherwise known as \"DOTs\"). When first starting out and getting your feet wet, this is generally an easy class to play, as healers and tanks are a bit more specialized.\r\nNow that you know what the roles are, you can review each class in detail to understand the benefits of each and which will support the role you want, as well as consider how your choice of class will affect the professions you choose to do (more on that later).\r\n\r\nKeep in mind:\r\nLeveling your character. In the beginning, your character spends most of its time questing and leveling, which basically involves killing and looting a lot of things. Leveling your character alone is harder to do as a \"clothy\" (such as Priest or Mage) or leatherwearer (such as Druid or Rogue) than it is as a character who can eventually wear mail (Hunter or Shaman, at level 40) or plate (such as a Warrior or Paladin). On the other hand, most clothies and leatherwearers can both heal themselves and do damage, making them a little more self-sufficient for leveling.\r\nNot every class can perform every role. This means that you cannot play a Warrior and expect to be a healer, too. But several classes can perform more than one role\u2014in fact, some characters, like Druids and Paladins, can do all three roles!\r\nSome roles are more challenging than others. Healing and tanking can be stressful, requiring a lot of tactical knowledge and perfect timing, with everyone's \"lives\" in your hands. DPS is generally less challenging, but can be very involved, depending on the situation. At times, it requires multitasking, paying close attention to what's going on around you, so you can stay healthy so the healer can focus on the tank (common sense things, like, don't stand in a fire or be too near the mob when it's spraying poison everywhere), keep \"adds\" away from the healer so the healer doesn't die (if the healer dies, the tank dies, then everyone else dies), and assist with helping those who cannot help themselves (like freeing others from immobilizing webs).\r\nEase of getting into raids and dungeons. Because healing and tanking are more challenging, fewer people choose to play them. This means that if you want to do a lot of raiding and dungeons, you generally will have to wait for less time than a DPS character to get in. I find that healers, especially, are sought after.\r\nPVP versus PVE. For someone like me, I focus on player versus environment (PVE) for the most part. I do not like player versus player (PVP). If you want to do PVP, though, this may also factor into your decision for what class to be and the role you wish to play.\r\nTip: In the end, if you really can't decide or want to focus on more than one role, you can do Dual Talent Specialization at Level 30.\r\nGlyphs and Talents\r\nAs you progress in the game, you will be able to fill your talent tree and glyph table. It's best to consult experienced class players and do research to find out what combinations work best for what role you wish to play.

Aside from your gear, your choices in this area are the most deciding factor in your efficiency and effectiveness in your role.\r\nFaction\r\nNow that you know what role you want to play, you can start to build your character. First you must decide if you want to play Horde or Alliance, which are the two main factions in the game.\r\n\r\nIt is less of a choice between \"good\" and \"bad,\" and more of a choice between:\r\nAlliance - Fanciful, attractive, \"normal\" characters with angelic, clean appearances (like Humans!)\r\nHorde - Gruesome, less traditional characters with missing jaws and grotesquely colored skin with bones poking out (like undead Humans!)\r\nSince more attractive races (like Blood Elves) have been added to the Horde side, in the end, it's really just about your preference for the design of the available races in each and their respective leveling areas, and how each race combines with their available classes (not all races can play every class).\r\nRace\r\nJust as every class cannot perform every role, every race cannot play every class. This means that if you want to play a Night Elf, but you also want to be a Shaman, you must eventually choose between being a Shaman or being a Night Elf because you cannot be both. Sometimes a desire to play a particular race dictates your class choice; however, I think it is most typical for people to choose their class first, then select which race to be within that parameter.\r\n\r\nAlso, some classes just lend themselves to a particular race; for example, Trolls make good hunters because of a Bow Specialization ability they have innately. So, it's good to look over the abilities each race is \"born\" with to see how that might coincide with your plans.\r\nNaming Your Character\r\nOdds are, the name you want will be taken. If this is the case, these are the tactics I use to try to still get the name I want, even if it isn't what I originally envisioned:\r\nAdd an extra character to the end or the beginning\r\nCreate an anagram\r\nTry a different language (baby name websites are very handy for this!)\r\nUse wikipedia to find a nuance to name your character after\r\nSpell it phonetically\r\nTake out the vowels\r\nAnd then here are some examples from my characters:\r\nNareendi - Anagram of \"Draenei\" with an extra \"n.\"\r\nDayoodin - This character's original name was \"Deudan,\" an anagram of \"undead,\" but everyone kept pronouncing it wrong, so I changed it to the phonetic spelling of \"Dayoodin\"\r\nSchattena - I'd heard a long time ago that \"Schatten\" is German for \"shadow.\" I wanted my shadow priest to have this name, but it was taken, so I just added an extra \"a\" at the end.\r\nHexa - I originally wanted \"Hexe,\" which was taken, so I changed the last \"e\" to an \"a\"! It wasn't taken, and I ended up liking it better than the original name I wanted.\r\nRmplstltskn - I wanted a Goblin Warlock named \"Rumpelstiltskin,\" but that name is too long, so I just took out the vowels.\r\nCrepuscular - This word describes animals that are active at twilight. I gave it to my Druid as her name because she turns into a bat when she flies. (I know, I am a super ultra nerd.)\r\nChoosing Professions\r\nWhen you are level 5, you will be able to choose your professions. While your character is out and about questing, you can work on these professions, which can be handy in several ways:\r\nMake your own food, clothing, gems, mounts, potions, bandages, and other items\r\nMake money by selling items on the Auction House\r\nGarner achievements and titles\r\nGarner special skills, abilities, and resistances\r\nThere are primary, secondary, and tertiary professions.\r\nPrimary\r\nWith the primary professions, you can only pick two.", "start_char_idx": 3750, "end_char_idx": 8092, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c5404c9-4951-4450-8743-0c52d634e1a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c5404c9-4951-4450-8743-0c52d634e1a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7523843-0fdd-40f3-b71a-bfb26701ce52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef8028515cf55bc3d3dfbaba1899205dc6291adf629fecc3df3c35e7abd15933", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b154cd0d-dd1d-4346-b1d9-e444a15ea122", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5870decf34ff7539e2d269996f5b7ec84530aa058421efcf2b1d3f8136a9dc4f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "376a1934-b080-4e4c-a2d9-2a5a1ac13275", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8536a629bfddda8eb5bfd88cf62d51fd11b4f8d48fd3aacaeba82508ac2b006", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Crepuscular - This word describes animals that are active at twilight.

It is important to think this through thoroughly because, even though you can change professions later, it is a lot of work and very time-consuming because you must go back to Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms and raise your professions from 0\u2014it is like leveling your character all over again.\r\n\r\nIdeally, you want:\r\nThe output from one profession to work as the input for the other. This simply means that I am not going to choose Herbalism as one profession and Leatherworking as the other--it would make more sense to choose Skinning and Leatherworking because then you have one gathering profession (Skinning) which works as the input for the crafting profession (Leatherworking).\r\nTo find an advantage to using a certain profession with your race or class. Choose professions that make sense for them to do because it gives you an advantage; for example, as a leather wearer, Leatherworking can be a good choice because you can make some of your own clothing. Or, if you are a Hunter, Skinning is good because, as you progress, you can not only make clothing for yourself, you earn a Master of Anatomy ability that increases your critical strike chance, which is handy for bow users\u2014so much the better if you are a Troll, who, as I mentioned earlier, is \"born\" with an innate Bow Specialization trait. And, some races have an affinity for a particular profession; for example, Draenei are \"born\" with an innate Gem Cutting ability so doing Jewelcrafting makes sense and Tauren are \"born\" with a Cultivation ability which makes herbalism a natural for them.\r\nTo pick professions that are not unattainable for your play level. Some primary professions are easy because they are simple gathering professions that fit nicely with other primary professions; these are: Skinning, Herbalism, and Mining. Other primary professions, like Leatherworking, Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Inscription require the output from these gathering professions, as well as more time and gold, but they are not overly challenging. The remaining primary professions (Enchanting, Engineering, Jewelcrafting, Tailoring) are more advanced, requiring more gold, planning, and patience, but also output from the gathering and less-involved crafting professions and even a reliance on others players to gain experience. These latter professions do not make very good starter professions and work best if you have a lot of gold or you have other high-level, established characters who can help you provide output from other professions. For example, while you can get jewels or metals from Mining, you can't cut the jewels into what you need for enchanting unless you also have Jewelcrafting, nor can you melt the metal into the rods or bars you need unless you also have Blacksmithing. So, it really takes three professions to be a jewelcrafter, but you can only select two--this is where it helps to have another character who might be a miner or a blacksmith (or a guild that can help you out).\r\n\r\nSecondary\r\nSecondary professions are less involved. And, unlike, the primary professions, you can do as many as you want, rather than picking only a couple.\r\n\r\nI tend to train them all from the get-go so I don't have to play catch-up later, as I'd rather dig up fossils, fish, cook while I'm already questing in an area where the lakes have the level of fish I need, the mobs drop the cloth and meat I need, and the ground has the items I need to dig up. This is vastly preferable to returning to all the low-level lands as an 85 grinding and killing mobs for their drops or paying insane prices on the Auction House for supplies when you get too bored to collect them yourself.

These are passive and nothing that you train for specifically.\r\nSetting Up Your User Interface\r\nYou don't have to download a bunch of fancy add-ons to make your interface work for you. I still find all that intimidating and I've been playing for years. Here are a few simple user interface changes I made, though, to help a bit--all but one of these are all done directly in the WoW UI without downloading an add-on. To get to the interface menu, I press ESC and click Interface in the list that appears, though there may be other methods.\r\nToolbars and Key Bindings\r\nThe WoW interface comes with several toolbars for the middle and left and right sides (all under Interface > ActionBars). However, I found this was not enough, so the only add-on I have is one that allows me to have more toolbars than are available by default. Along with these, key bindings (press ESC and click Key Bindings) are an important way to create mindless efficiency.\r\n\r\nWoW has some default key bindings that are helpful in pulling up information about your character. These are all available in the lower right of the toolbar near your bag information. By pressing one letter, you can pull up your character information, your list of quests, your bags, and more! Run your mouse over each to see what letter to use. One that isn't listed that might be useful is that to see your friends, open your friends list by typing the letter O.\r\nMap\r\nIf it isn't done for you by default, zoom out on the map in the upper left all the way, so that you can see the biggest area possible. This is especially helpful with trying to perform gathering professions or as a hunter to see mobs. At this time, you can also make sure your map is \"showing\" the things you want to see (such as where a bank is or where the nearest herbs are).\r\nInformation Windows\r\nThere are chat-type information windows that appear by default on your screen: General and Combat Log. The general one is pretty much a chat window and the combat log is a \"what happened\" window that gives you specific details of fights, including what happened to you, what happened to others, what you did to others, and more. I stack these on top of one another, instead of leaving them in the default tab state. It takes up more UI space, but I can see them both at once, which is more important to me and not too distracting if I make them transparent. You can change the colors, transparency, and all sorts of details to make them as useful to you as possible.\r\nTip: With regard to interacting with other characters, you do this in the General window. This can be both fun or bothersome:\r\nFun. You can do some RP, if you want, such as typing /hug or /highfive or /dance\u2014the options are endless! I don't do it too much, but if someone helps me defeat a mob or rezzes me after I died in a dungeon, I do a /thank. Just like in real life, small things like that make a big difference in interacting with people!\r\nBothersome. If someone is pestering you with whispers while you're out questing or yelling profanities in a large city, you can always /ignore their character. This way, anything they \"say\" will never appear in your chat window again.

If you ever get frustrated because it seems like there's a \"bug\" in a quest, first stop and read the quest text thoroughly to make sure you aren't missing an element.\r\nTip: By reading the quest text, you can also learn the lore of the game, which can be fun and interesting, as well as help with an understanding of why things are the way they are.\r\nAutoloot\r\nAutoloot is your friend\u2014be sure to turn it on! Select the Auto Loot checkbox under Interface > Controls.\r\nFunding Your Character\r\nI use \"older\" characters to purchase and send larger bags to my new character so they have more room for items while questing, as well as to send a little gold (50G lasts a while for new characters) to assist with training and such.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have older characters, don't fret. The game makes sure you at least get enough money from quest rewards and looting (always loot your kills\u2014not only do you get money but they might drop an item that starts a new quest line that you would otherwise miss!) to be able to do your training and professions and to be able to do riding when it's time for that. To earn extra, along with normal gray and white drops that you can sell at any vendor, be sure to auction any green or blue drops you get that you can't use that are \"bind when equipped\" in the Auction House, as well as any output from your professions. The things that may have to wait are usually just superficial, like fancy gear you can buy at the Auction House, frivolities like companion pets, and, later, epic cold weather flying\u2014all of which you'll earn in time, but you can't expect to have right away.\r\nTraining\r\nThe game is very obvious about it when it's time to train a new ability\u2014like talent points, it tells you in the UI when you level up if there are any new spells you can get from your trainer.\r\nGear\r\nI alluded earlier to the fact that some characters can wear cloth, others plate, still others leather. What is important to know here is that there are varying types of plate, varying types of cloth, varying types of mail, etc. This means that just because a piece is mail does not mean it is best for your Shaman, as it may contain stats that are meant for a Hunter. Similarly, just because a piece is cloth, it doesn't mean that it's meant for a Priest\u2014it might be better for a Mage.\r\nTip: Pay attention to any armor proficiencies you gain; for example, when a Shaman hits level 40, they can wear mail instead of just cloth or leather, which greatly reduces squishiness.\r\nGuild\r\nIf you don't already have a guild, you can keep an eye out for guild invitations, making sure that your goals for the game coincide with the guild's goals (for example, don't join a raiding guild if you don't want raiding to be your main focus in the game).\r\nTip: Sometimes an easy way to earn gold, especially if you are just starting out and have no higher-level characters to fund you, is if you are in a large city and someone is asking for people to sign their guild charter for 5 or 10 gold.", "start_char_idx": 14804, "end_char_idx": 19188, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27c01d29-36d7-4158-8a40-6a0fd00eb73b": {"__data__": {"id_": "27c01d29-36d7-4158-8a40-6a0fd00eb73b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7523843-0fdd-40f3-b71a-bfb26701ce52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef8028515cf55bc3d3dfbaba1899205dc6291adf629fecc3df3c35e7abd15933", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "49973dc1-ff75-497e-899b-ff45911bccce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "45ac89a267b87800d9c653b5e6c9d90fd9e1970b899af85aea1a74a265dc822a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Similarly, just because a piece is cloth, it doesn't mean that it's meant for a Priest\u2014it might be better for a Mage.\r\nTip: Pay attention to any armor proficiencies you gain; for example, when a Shaman hits level 40, they can wear mail instead of just cloth or leather, which greatly reduces squishiness.\r\nGuild\r\nIf you don't already have a guild, you can keep an eye out for guild invitations, making sure that your goals for the game coincide with the guild's goals (for example, don't join a raiding guild if you don't want raiding to be your main focus in the game).\r\nTip: Sometimes an easy way to earn gold, especially if you are just starting out and have no higher-level characters to fund you, is if you are in a large city and someone is asking for people to sign their guild charter for 5 or 10 gold. If you are guildless, you can sign the charter, get the gold, then /gquit (sometimes you won't have a choice and they'll kick you out because they have specific plans for the guild).\r\nLeveling\r\nThe more characters you make, the more you'll become acquainted with how it works. You start in the super newb-newb area (until about level 3), then go to the newb-newb area (level 5 or so), then the newb area (level 10 or so), and then you are released into the wide world on your own! Typically what happens is: You get a quest where you kill a bunch of things, then you get a quest to kill a smaller bunch of similar-but-tougher things, then you get a quest to kill the leader of those bunches of things and then the quest chain ends and you get a piece of gear. The quest chain you do to get The Green Hills of Stranglethorn is a perfect example of this.\r\nTip: While leveling, do all the quests in an area to earn the questing achievement for it and also complete the map of the area to get that achievement. The more of that you do now, the less you have to do later when you are \"grown-up\"! (I am big into killing two or more birds with one stone in this game, if I can.)\r\nConclusion\r\nObviously, there are a lot of other game nuances I have not gone over here, especially given all of the patches that have gone in since I wrote this 10 years ago (it's 2022 now) and all the confusing re-releasings of everything, but in general these are the very basics that will get you started on the right foot.", "start_char_idx": 18378, "end_char_idx": 20688, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name":
