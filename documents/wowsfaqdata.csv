In-Game goods,"How to activate the visibility of special content (ARP ships, Transformers, etc.)","If you can't find some special ships such as Arpeggio, please check if they are set to be displayed:

Open the ""Additional Content"" filter by clicking the cogwheels icon located in the lower-right corner of the Port (just above the ship carousel).
Check if there is a green eye mark on the right side of Arpeggio or other special ships.
If the eye symbol is white and crossed, those ships or their unique camouflages won't be displayed. In battle, they will be replaced by standard versions of the ships with standard permanent camouflages. 

If this does not fix your problem, please contact Player Support to resolve the issue."

Mechanics,All about consumables,"Consumables are used in battle to boost the characteristics of your ship or to enable extra features for a certain period of time.

In most cases, the number of consumable ""charges"" is limited, but some types can be activated an unlimited number of times throughout the entire battle; you only need to wait for them to cool down before you can use them again.

General Information
You can view ship consumables in the ""Equipment"" tab. After each battle, any used consumable charges will be automatically resupplied for free.

equip.jpg
Each ship type has their own set of consumables. In certain cases, the list of consumables may change depending on the hull that you install.

After each battle, any used consumable charges are automatically resupplied free of charge.

The consumable cooldown timer countdown begins after the consumable duration ends rather than at the moment of its activation.

The consumable cooldown time can be reduced by 5% with the help of the November Foxtrot signal and by 10% with the help of Consumables Specialist skill.

The number of uses can be increased by one (except for aircraft carrier squadrons) ""charge"" by mastering the Superintendent skill, as well as with the help of a special talent that some unique Commanders have.

The active duration of consumables can be increased by using a range of standard or special upgrades, as well as with the help of Commander skills.

The unique upgrades of some Tier X ships can affect the characteristics of certain consumables.

To learn more about consumables, please follow this link: https://worldofwarships.com/en/content/education/enhancements/"
Mechanics,"How Do You Earn and Spend Credits, Doubloons, and XP?","We're going to tell you how you can earn XP and Credits in battle, and why Credits and Doubloons can be deducted after each battle. By using this information to your advantage, you can earn more XP and Credits at the end of every battle, and you can also make yourself even more useful to your team and increase your chances of winning.

To learn more about how you can earn and spend Credits, Doubloons, and XP, please follow the link: https://worldofwarships.com/en/content/education/in-game_economy/"
Mechanics,How do I earn XP and Credits?,"Active participation in the battle increases your earnings. This includes:

Capturing and defending Key Areas.
Total damage to ships and destroyed ships.
Total damage to aircraft and destroyed aircraft.
Potential damage.
Detection of enemy ships, aircraft, and torpedoes.
Damage upon your spotting.
General contribution to the battle.
Capturing and defending Key Areas
The more points you earn when capturing a Key Area, the greater the reward you will receive.

The reward is guaranteed if you defend your Key Area. The more points you block while the enemy is capturing the Key Area, the more XP and Credits you will receive at the end of the battle.

Credits and XP for defending a Key Area are awarded in any case, regardless of the outcome of the battle and the way you won or lost (destroying all enemy ships or capturing the Key Area).

Total damage to ships and destroyed ships
Total damage to ships and the number of destroyed ships are tracked statistics that contribute to your earnings.

The rewards for damage are determined by the percentage of the target ship's hit points removed, not the amount of raw damage dealt. Removing 20% of a destroyer's HP will generate the same base earnings as removing 20% of a same-tier battleship's HP.

This rule is implemented because different ship types and ships in the game have different HP pool sizes. The more damage you deal to enemy ships, the more XP and Credits you get at the end of the battle.

No XP or Credits are awarded for damage dealt to ship modules or for critical module damage.

Tier VIII and X aircraft carriers differ from other ship types: Tier VIII and X carriers earn more XP for dealing damage (about 5% more for Tier VIII and 15% for Tier X) and less for winning battles. This means that carrier players who perform well but lose a battle are less likely to appear at the bottom of their team score list.

Total damage to aircraft and destroyed aircraft
The economic reward for destroying aircraft is distributed in the same way as the reward for damage to ships and destroyed ships. Credits and XP are awarded not only for destroyed aircraft but also for damage dealt to aircraft. The aircraft type (attack aircraft, torpedo bomber, or bomber) does not matter. However, if you destroy an enemy aircraft while playing an aircraft carrier, you earn more XP and Credits.

Potential damage
Potential damage is the sum of the maximum damage of all shells, bombs, torpedoes, etc. that hit a ship or pass within 700 m of it.

The higher your ship tier, the higher the base earnings you receive for the battle. However, the cost of servicing your ship (ammunition resupply and damage repair) also increases.

When the battle is over, all of your actions in the battle determine the sums of XP and Credits you earn. 

If your team wins, you will receive more XP than if you lose."
Mechanics,Why are Credits (Doubloons) deducted after a battle?,"Credits are deducted after each battle to service your ship. (https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Ship:The_Economics_of_Battle?_gl=1*17k96yr*_gcl_au*MTMzMDk1NDE4OS4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*FPAU*MTMzMDk1NDE4OS4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*_ga*MTIzMTg5NDA3Ny4xNzA3NDI0NTA4*_ga_BWRKLL4HR5*MTcxNDUwMjg0Ny4xNC4xLjE3MTQ1MTQyNDQuNTguMC4zMjc0MTE5MDI.*_fplc*cWphQXRsWVVPaFBialE2QU1CTlZHQzlpdG0lMkJwSXhSRWRmN2l4VWhKRVJBbGZuZWNtR2dBTzFrVzUlMkZHNE5XalFYZEFDNXZTdWc2TlJ0WDd5ZVVwbXdtQ1Bja05UaURBZ2JyakxncDQlMkZGUXhDdUhaU0xjWG5OVWZwNFU4Q1h3JTNEJTNE&_ga=2.38094563.1366991284.1714502847-1231894077.1707424508) If you do not earn enough Credits to cover this in a battle, they are deducted from your account balance. Operating costs include:

Ammunition resupply
Credits are deducted for spent:

Main battery shells
Torpedoes
Aircraft ammunition
Depth Charge Airstrike and Depth Charges armament uses
Service cost
The service cost is a flat fee that depends on the tier, type, and Premium status of the ship.

Camouflage
If a camouflage is mounted and the automatic resupply option is on, its cost will be deducted from the account.

Additional information
Different types of battles have different profitability. For instance, players will earn fewer Credits in Co-op Battles than in Random Battles. As for Operations, the sum of earned Credits depends on the number of earned Stars, as well as on the individual results of each player. More Credits can be earned when you deal damage to higher-tier ships."
Mechanics,How Does the Matchmaker Select Teams?,"The matchmaker forms teams in two stages:

A combat group is formed taking into account the applicable limits (see below) and battle-tier settings for each ship.
From the ships selected for the combat group, a team is formed based on the principle of the maximum equality of the sums of the ships' balance weights.
The balance weight is a characteristic of a ship that takes into account the ship power as part of a team and does not reflect the actual power balance between two specific ships.

When matching teams, the matchmaker tends to evenly distribute ships in terms of nations."
Mechanics,How Does the Matchmaker Determine the Battle Tier for a Ship?,"The maximum battle tier that all Tier I–IV ships can get put into is calculated according to the following formula: Ship tier + 1.
The maximum battle tier that all other ships can get put into is calculated according to the following formula: Ship tier + 2.
There can be up to three aircraft carriers in each team in battle.
The battle tier is equal to the tier of the highest-tier ship in a combat group."
Mechanics,Limits for Matching Teams,"The following limits are set for matching teams:

The maximum number of players in battle is 24.
The maximum number of aircraft carriers in battle is 2–6.
The number of top-tier ships and battleships of tiers lower than the battle tier in both teams should be the same.
Aircraft carriers in both teams should be of the same tier.
The numbers of destroyers and battleships can differ by 1.
The number of cruisers can differ by 2."
Mechanics,Player Queue,"In Random Battles, when players click the ""Battle!"" button, they enter the list of players not yet assigned to a battle, which is continuously processed by the matchmaker. When the list of unassigned players is processed, players' waiting times are taken into account—those who have waited longer get processed first.

If there are no suitable battles for the player in terms of their tier or ship type (for example, the player has selected an aircraft carrier and the limit for this ship type has already been reached in all battles suitable for their tier), a new battle gets created for this player."
Mechanics,Waiting Time,"If waiting time is too long, a battle can start with an incomplete lineup (10х10, 11х11, etc.), but the limits in terms of ship types and numbers are maintained (see above)."
Mechanics,Superships,"Access to Superships
Superships are positioned just after Tier X ships in the Tech Tree. These special ships have mechanics that are entirely new for our game, which makes for a noticeable qualitative jump from Tier X ships. To purchase a specific supership, you must also research the Tier X ship of the corresponding branch. It's not necessary to research superships.

The cost of purchasing superships depends on their type:

Super battleships: 57 million Credits.
Super carriers: 48 million Credits.
Super cruisers: 47.5 million Credits.
Super destroyers: 45 million Credits.
Supership Economics
Superships yield Credits at the level of Tier X ships.
The cost of servicing superships is 360,000 Credits.
Permanent camouflages for superships are purchased separately from the ships, just like for other researchable ships from the Tech Tree.
Permanent camouflages for superships do not reduce their service cost or increase their Credit earnings."
Mechanics,Alternative Fire Mode: Burst Fire,"Each turret has one additional firing mode that is activated by pressing the F key. After switching to this mode, each separate turret can automatically deliver several consecutive salvos in rapid succession. After firing, the guns take a long time to reload.

Depending on the ship, activating this mode can change the characteristics of guns and shells.

You can switch back to the standard firing mode by pressing the F key. However, to fire again, you'll need to wait until all turrets have ceased firing in the alternative fire mode. A long reload period will follow a switch in firing mode, after which the turrets will be able to fire in either standard or alternative fire mode again."
Mechanics,Alternative Torpedoes,"Two types of torpedoes that can be switched between in battle. The torpedoes differ by various parameters such as range, speed, and damage.

Switching to alternative torpedoes takes an additional fixed amount of time that's separate from the reloading mechanic. Torpedo launcher reloading is suspended while switching between torpedo types and then resumes immediately after. "
Mechanics,Combat Instructions,"Combat Instructions grant a temporary boost to the ships' characteristics in battle. To activate the bonus, you need to fill a special meter by carrying out ""adjustment fire"" at any locked target—each turret salvo that hits a target or splashes near it is taken into account. Once the meter is filled, the bonus is activated by pressing the F key, which allows you to use the boost at the most optimal moment of your choosing.

Depending on the ship, activating this mode can change the characteristics of guns and shells.

If your ship ceases firing for some time, the progress of the adjustment fire meter gradually resets. However, progress won't decrease while the bonus is active or if the adjustment fire meter is already full. "
Mechanics,Tactical Squadrons,"The ships carry two types of squadrons: standard and tactical. While standard squadrons are a carrier's striking power that players are already familiar with, tactical squadrons constitute a new weapon.

Tactical squadrons on board the new supercarriers are composed of very fast jet-propelled aircraft. This feature allows them to quickly cover substantial distances and carry out lightning-fast attacks against enemy ships.

The specific characteristics of tactical squadrons depend on the ship."
Mechanics,Vehicles: ship upgrades,"Each ship can be upgraded with additional equipment. These upgrades are sets of special engineering solutions that improve various characteristics of ships.

Upgrades improve the combat characteristics of various ship systems.

There are different types of upgrades that improve the characteristics and HP of combat modules—for example, upgrades for main armaments, secondary battery guns, or air groups. Upgrades coupled with properly chosen Commander skills can significantly improve certain ship characteristics.

Players who have reached Service Record Level 11 can install upgrades.

Upgrade types:
The following types of upgrades exist:

Standard. Available to all players for Credits in the corresponding tab in the Port.
Special. Can be purchased in the Armory for Coal.
Unique. Can be obtained in the Research Bureau category of the Armory for Research Points. Unique upgrades can only be used on certain Tier X ships. If you sell a unique upgrade, you can restore it later by following this guide (https://na.wargaming.net/support/en/products/wows/article/22943/).
"
Mechanics,What Are Ranked Battles and How to Play Them?,"Ranked Battles are a special competitive battle type where players fight against each other in two-team battles, advance through ranks in leagues, and earn valuable rewards. The battle type is available from Access Level 16.

Ranked Battles are divided into seasons. Ranked Battles seasons are held on a regular basis with short breaks between each one. This means that you can choose between Random, Co-op, and Ranked Battles, as the latter battle type is almost regularly available.

To switch to the Ranked Battles mode, click the ""Select battle type"" inscription to the right of the ""Battle!"" button in the Port.
 
Then select ""Ranked Battle"" on the battle-type screen that opens."
Mechanics,How to Participate in Ranked Battles,"The structure and rules of Ranked Battles may differ depending on the season.

Season achievements aren't inherited from previous Ranked seasons and won’t transfer to those that follow."
Mechanics,Ranked Seasons and Sprints,"Ranked Battles are held in the format of seasons with short breaks between them.

Each season is divided into several Sprints.

The Sprint is the main time frame in a Ranked Battles season, and its duration is determined by the rules of the current season (usually a week or two).

Within each Sprint, a player can reach Rank 1 in their current league and qualify for the next league. If a player qualifies, they will start the next Sprint from the lowest rank of the next league. If a player fails to qualify, their progress will be reset and they will start the next Sprint at the lowest rank of their current league.

There are no qualifications in the highest league. This means that progress resets with the start of each new Sprint, even if Rank 1 was achieved."
Mechanics,Ranked Stars and Ranks,"Progress in Ranked Battles involves moving from one league to another. To do so, you need to earn Ranked Stars. These Stars earned allow you to attain new ranks and qualify for the next league.

A Star is awarded for a victory and deducted for a loss or a draw; however, a Star can be kept in a lost battle if you take first place in your team in terms of the battle results (relevant for some leagues only).

Ranks are divided into revocable and irrevocable types. When losing a Star, a revocable rank will be lost. You cannot lose an irrevocable rank. Irrevocable ranks are visually highlighted with a special color fill inside the emblem."
Mechanics,Ranked Qualification,"Qualification is a special rank that unlocks after reaching Rank 1 in the current league (except for the highest league). Qualification battles involve those who are trying to qualify for the higher league and players of that higher league.

These battles are fought according to the rules of the higher league. "
Mechanics,Ranked Rewards,"You can earn various rewards for participating in Ranked Battles: Coal, Steel, expendable camouflages, Doubloons, commemorative flags, Ranked Tokens, etc. Rewards are given for:

A certain number of victories in a league
Reaching Rank 1 in a league
Qualifying for the next league
Rewards are refreshed every Sprint and can be earned repeatedly.

The final reward for participating in a Ranked Battles season is a Ranked Token. Ranked Tokens can be exchanged in the Armory for stylish permanent camouflages."
Missions & Events,Birthday Gifts: FAQ,"30 of September 2021 we launched the Player Birthday campaign and here are the answers to some frequently asked questions.

""I didn't get any gifts!""
Please check if all conditions are met:

your date of birth is specified on the Account Management page
your account is linked to your email address and confirmed
you gave us permission to send you letters
you played at least 1 WoWS battle in the last 365 days
Also please note that you can only get gifts after getting a B-day email, so if you haven't received the email, you won't get a gift.
All conditions are met, but I still don't get the B-day email!
Our email service processes data once a day. If you set the date of birth in your profile today, you will get the email no earlier than the next day.

I got my social network profile linked to my WG account and my date of birth on the Account Management page is set from the social network profile, can I get presents?
Yes, if you link and confirm your email and agree to receive emails from us. On your Birthday you will receive the email and will get your gifts in the game.

Please note that no player can get more than 1 gift in 365 days."
Missions & Events,"I was extremely close to completing a mission when the time limit was reached, can I get the reward anyway?","We know that situations like this can feel tough, especially after you have dedicated time to the game and when you want to get as much as possible from our special offers and contests.

Unfortunately, Player Support is unable to assist with this specific topic, as the time limits of all missions are set in stone.

Making any exceptions in such situations would be unfair to those players who were able to achieve all the necessary goals in time and won the reward in this way.

Do note that when you are close to the end of the time limit for a particular combat mission, it is the finish time of the battle, not the start time, that determines whether the results can be counted toward completing that mission."

Clans,Naval Battles: Quick Guide,"Under the Naval Battle section of the Clan tab, your Clan's Commander or Deputy Commander can opt in your Clan for the week. They can check the box beneath the button to automatically opt into future weeks.

The Naval Battle is held every week and consists of two stages. The Preparation stage runs from Monday through Thursday. The Engagement stage spans Friday through Sunday. To earn the right to compete against your opponents, your Clan has to complete a special mission during the Preparation stage.

Clans from all servers that complete the combat mission during the Preparation stage compete against other Clans from Friday through Sunday.

Clan vs. Clan is the standard format for the Engagement stage. A group format was added in Update 0.10.10. Starting from Update 0.10.11, the standard format of the Engagement stage is replaced by the group format every 4 weeks. Clans are randomly divided between several groups of 25 or 50 Clans each, and they compete against each other within the group according to the same rules that apply in a Clan vs. Clan format.

The Clan objective in a group format is to earn as many Stars as possible for completing missions from a table and take a higher place in the group.

A table will display the types and nations of ships that can be helmed into battle:
 
NOTE: During the Engagement stage, you need to have  ""Count Attempts"" enabled in the Naval Battle section for your progress to count toward your Clan's missions! Fight wisely—you only have a limited number of attempts to complete the mission.

Naval Battles may grant bonus Stars for clearing bars for randomly selected ship types/nations. More info about bonus Stars is available in the Naval Battle tab.

Oil is the main reward for the Naval Battle competition. It's earned by all participating Clans, depending on their level of activity."

Network settings,DNS server address is not found,"If you're unable to update or install World of Tanks, you may be encountering a DNS issue from your Internet service provider (ISP). This article will help you to address these issues.  

For World of Tanks: dl-wot-gc.wargaming.net
Flush your DNS Cache
Try changing your DNS server to Google Public DNS
Before you change your DNS settings to use Google Public DNS, be sure to write down the current server addresses or settings. It is very important that you keep these numbers for backup purposes, in case you need to revert to them at any time.

Google Public DNS IP addresses:
The Google Public DNS IP addresses (IPv4) are as follows:

8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4
The Google Public DNS IPv6 addresses are as follows:

2001:4860:4860::8888
2001:4860:4860::8844
You can use either address as your primary or secondary DNS server. You can specify both addresses, but do not specify the same address as both primary and secondary.

You can configure Google Public DNS addresses for either IPv4 or IPv6 connections, or both. For IPv6-only networks with a NAT64 gateway using the 64:ff9b::/96 prefix, you can use Google Public DNS64 instead of Google Public DNS IPv6 addresses, providing connectivity to IPv4-only services without any other configuration.

Some devices use separate fields for all eight parts of IPv6 addresses and cannot accept the :: IPv6 abbreviation syntax. For such fields enter:

2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888
2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8844

Select the connection for which you want to configure Google Public DNS. For example:
To change the settings for an Ethernet connection, right-click Local Area Connection -> Properties
To change the settings for a wireless connection, right-click Wireless Network Connection -> Properties
Select the Networking tab. Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and then click Properties

Click OK
Select ""Use the following DNS server addresses"". If there are any IP addresses listed in the Preferred DNS server or Alternate DNS server, write them down for future reference
Replace those addresses with the IP addresses of the Google DNS servers:
For IPv4: 8.8.8.8 and/or 8.8.4.4.
For IPv6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and/or 2001:4860:4860::8844.
For IPv6-only: you can use Google Public DNS64 instead of the IPv6 addresses in the previous point
