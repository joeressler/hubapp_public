Hi, I'm Joseph Ressler. I love programming, and I love game programming.
Please enjoy this app, I built it to get more experience with flask, Docker, and deploying apps in AWS.
I also learned the basics of building a chatbot using RAG LLM with the OpenAI API, which is trained on the World of Warships FAQ's.
