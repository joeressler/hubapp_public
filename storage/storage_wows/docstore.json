Example: D:\\Games\\World_of_Warships_RU\\res_mods\\0.7.10.1\\PNFMods\\owplugin folder.\r\nThis mod actively logs your game data while you play by reading python.log, damage dealt/taken, ribbons, frags, and list of battle participants. This information seems to be recorded to owevent.log file.\r\nWhile recording information the mod appears to decrease game performance. While we did not have time to test all configurations yet (as we wanted to share the information ASAP), we saw a decrease from 75 to 48-56 FPS on our i7-8700K / GTX1080Ti test machine.\r\nWe want to make you aware of the following information:\r\nIf the owplugin folder with the mod is deleted from World of Warships game files, Overwolf re-installs this when launched;\r\nIf Overwolf is uninstalled normally, the mod remains installed.\r\nWith that in mind, we would like to recommend the following:\r\n\r\nIf you have Overwolf, you can check the difference in game performance yourself. To do this, launch the game from Wargaming.net Game Center or Legacy Launcher in safe mode. Safe mode disables res_mods modifications which include the one installed by Overwolf.\r\nIf you want to stop using Overwolf, you will need to uninstall it AND manually delete the World of Warships mod. To do this:\r\nFind and delete the owplugin folder according to the games installation path on your machine.\r\nIf you\u2019re not sure or not experienced enough just clear the whole res_mods folder, you will need to reinstall any mods you\u2019ve been using.\r\nAlways read EULA of all products you use.

While it is formally a team-based game, you have to keep in mind at all times that your team can not be relied upon. Your team is your meatshield, you should not rely on them to do even the most basic of tasks, and they exist almost solely to buy you enough time to make the most out of your own ship\u2019s strengths and use them to carry yourself and up to 11 other dead weights to victory. \r\nThis may sound extremely cynical, but this is what the design of the game encourages. There is very little mandatory ship synergy in the game and almost every ship is designed to operate as an individual unit.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t blame your team unless you have played your ship to the peak of its abilities. Focus on thinking about what you could have done better in the given situation rather than wasting your energy and malding over your teammates.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to remember is to know what your ship\u2019s strengths and win conditions are, and also what your weaknesses are. You have to learn them by playing the game, using guides like this and observing how other proficient players play their ships. Don\u2019t try pulling off bullshit like early game torpedo rushes or getting into range of your secondary guns in the early game just because you saw somebody else pull it off once in a thousand games. Stick to what your ship can consistently do well and avoid doing what you can\u2019t do. \r\n\r\nYou will have to learn the enemy\u2019s weaknesses. There is a very large number of ships in the game, but you can ballpark rules on how to approach engagements with certain ship archetypes (like brawler BBs, fire support BBs, ranged DPS cruisers, radar cruisers, short range high DPM cruisers, torpedoboat DDs, gunboat DDs etc.). You also need to know things like approximate damage output, the drop of damage output with range, ammo type strengths, general feel of a ship\u2019s survivability, additional enemy strengths like torpedoes or radars, additional specific weaknesses like overmatchable plating etc. Such a list would be very comprehensive and at this moment I really can\u2019t be arsed coming up with one.\r\n\r\nAt first, play passively around punishing the enemy\u2019s mistakes, and only think about making flashy plays later in the game when the enemy numbers thin out. Balancing survival with dealing meaningful damage is exceptionally important to master.\r\n\r\nDefending is much easier than attacking due to how the game\u2019s mechanics are designed. By pushing you make your ship easier to hit, you can\u2019t control your engagement distance as effectively as when kiting, you can get into effective range of enemy torpedoes or generally walk into ambushes. Because of this, you should favour being on the defending flank rather than the attacking one. There is nothing cowardly about running away to keep an optimal distance from the enemy in order to win a fight.\r\n\r\nIf you are clearly winning, think about how the enemy can jeopardise your victory and take precautions to prevent it from happening,while maximising your own personal score.\r\n\r\nIf you are losing, think about how you can make plays that utilise your ship\u2019s strengths that can swing the game back into your team\u2019s favour. You also need to be able to recognise that a game is irrecoverably lost at a certain point, at which point you should look to maximise your personal score in order to maximise the earnings for the

calibre guns, powerful AP shells, long range, mostly good armour, but are relatively inaccurate (more or less), have bad concealment and are usually slower and less manoeuvrable than most other ship types\r\ntheir role in battle is tanking and/or fire support\r\nthey can be divided into several archetypes\r\nthe first division is by average engagement range \r\nbrawlers/close range (Germans (KM), Soviets (VMF))\r\nmid range BBs (USN, Brits (RN), French, Italians)\r\nlong range BBs (Japanese (IJN), some premiums like Slava, Thunderer, Incomparable, Constellation, Borodino)\r\nthe second

Slava, Thunderer, Incomparable, Constellation, Borodino)\r\nthese roles are not strict and more or less overlap in different ratios\r\n\r\nCruisers (CA/CLs) are the most diverse class\r\nby gun calibre, they're divided into ultralight (up to 130 mm guns; also known as anti-aircraft cruisers), light (140-180 mm), heavy (190-254 mm) and battlecruisers/large cruisers (283 mm and larger)\r\nultralight and light cruisers are usually more agile and stealthy than other cruisers, have higher damage output but also weaker armour and shorter effective range\r\nheavy cruisers, and especially battlecruisers, have guns that are more optimised for medium and long range combat, better armour and larger HP pools but worse manoeuvrability\r\nby archetype, they're divided on DPS, utility and tank cruisers\r\nDPS cruisers' main role is impacting games through damage (IJN CAs and CLs, KM CAs, FR CA/Ls, RN CAs, RN CLs when equipped with smoke, IT CAs, NL CAs, Pan Asian CLs, Salem, most cruisers below T8)\r\nutility cruisers impact games by controlling cap zones with their radar (USN CAs and CLs, VMF CLs, Tallinn, RN CLs equipped with radar)\r\ntank cruisers usually sacrifice damage output, and sometimes utility, for high survivability (VMF CAs, Pan American CLs, Napoli)\r\nthese roles can also overlap to varying degrees; for example, Moskva can be considered a tank/utility cruiser\r\n\r\nDestroyers (DDs) are also very diverse\r\nthe main division is on universal-type and DPS-type DDs - this depends on whether their concealment is good enough to contest capture zones comfortably (DPS types usually make up for this with good damage output)\r\nuniversal-type branches and ships are: USN DDs, IJN DDs (Shimakaze branch, and the Harugumo branch below T8), KM DDs (Z branch and pre-split), RN DDs, Ognevoi, Grozovoi, Neustrashimy, EU DDs (Halland branch), Tromp, Pan Asian DDs, Vampire\r\nDPS type branches and ships are: Forrest Sherman, FR DDs, KM DDs (Elbing branch), VMF DDs (except the above mentioned ones), IJN (Akizuki and above), IT DDs, EU DDs (Gdansk branch), Friesland/Groningen, Ragnar\r\nuniversal types are further divided into gunboats, torpedoboats and true hybrids, depending on their main damage source\r\nthe main role of universal-types is contesting cap zones in the early game, keeping enemy DDs in check, spotting enemy ships, and supporting with damage, smokes or other forms of utility\r\nDPS types' main role is doing damage, flanking and disrupting the enemy team, whereas contesting cap zones is secondary and is usually done in the mid to late game\r\n\r\nAircraft carriers (CVs) are a class that is designed around applying damage anywhere on the map with relatively low risk, and the interaction between them and other ships is quite superficial, which is why they're almost universally hated\r\ntheir main role is doing damage and killing ships, with spotting as a secondary role with strike aircraft or fighters (even though they can deploy fighter patrols, they are mostly useless for defending allies)\r\n\r\nSubmarines (subs) are mostly assassins, sneaking up to enemy ships and pumping their face full of torpedoes or trying to hit the enemy with homing torpedoes from a distance while remaining undetected; much like with CVs, counterplay options against subs are quite limited and the tactics they employ are extremely annoying for most players to interact with", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4210, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

branch), IJN BBs, IJN cruisers, German cruisers, Soviet cruisers (Nevsky branch), IJN DDs  (Shimakaze branch), USN DDs, German DDs (Z-52 branch) and German subs.

Co-op gives you about 50% less XP and credits compared to other game modes.\r\nIf you are playing Operations, you should aim to do them with all secondary objectives completed because they will increase your rewards.\r\n\r\nPremium account gives you x1,65 bonus XP, free XP and captain XP, as well as x1,5 credits. There are also various economic bonuses you can mount on your ship.\r\n\r\nCredits: they are earned mostly based on the relative damage dealt to enemy ships (in other words, damage is calculated by % of the target's max HP pool dealt), as well as the tier difference between your ship and the enemy. For example, 10k damage to a DD is worth about 25k damage to a cruiser, or about 50k damage to a BB. What this means is, if you have a choice of targets to damage reliably, you should go for the target of the highest tier with the lowest total HP pool, unless you have more immediate threats pressuring you.\r\nAs far as ships for grinding credits are concerned, the best premium ships are T9 ones. I recommend Kearsarge as your first T9 purchase because it is available completely for free, and is the most overpowered T9 premium currently available. Other recommended T9 premiums include Tulsa, Carnot, Groningen and Neustrashimy (you can find the full list of recommendations on the bottom of this document). If you don\u2019t have the patience to grind coal or free XP for a T9 premium or aren\u2019t willing to spend that much money, consider getting a T8 or lower premium. Note that T5 and lower premiums earn way too little credits and are as such not worth investing into.\r\nIf you are unwilling or unable to invest into premium ships, have a few T6 and 7 tech tree ships because they bring the most profit out of all tech tree ships. You won\u2019t lose money with lower tier ships, but you will usually break even with T8s, and lose money regularly with T9 and 10. That\u2019s how the game\u2019s economy and business model are designed, and it encourages you to invest into premium ships and/or premium time.\r\nBefore you decide on buying a premium ship, I have to ask you: Please do not buy your way into high tiers. You are better off grinding your way into the high tier tech tree ships because you will gradually learn the game and have better fighting chances than suddenly jumping into a completely unknown metagame.\r\n\r\nXP: Ship-bound XP is awarded on similar principles to credits (relative damage and tier difference), with the added bonus of an extra 15% of a ship\u2019s worth of XP being awarded for a kill. What this means is, you get 115% XP for killing a ship from full HP to 0. In order to maximise XP gains, you should focus on finishing off your targets, but not \u201ckill stealing\u201d because that will end the game too quickly.\r\n\r\nFree XP and elite captain XP: 10% of earned base XP is mirrored to the free XP pool, and you can increase the earnings with the same methods as for ship-bound XP. The most efficient way to earn free and captain XP, however, is to play Clan battles in a team with a high win rate because every winning player is rewarded 2500 base XP, which is equivalent to an exceptionally good game in a T10 ship in random battles.\r\nAlso note that when you eventually bring a captain to level 21, all captain XP earned by him will be transferred to the elite XP pool.\r\n\r\nCoal: This is a time-gated resource because there is a limit of how much you can earn per day. The fastest way to earn coal is to collect all available daily resource containers, each of which gives you a minimum of 400 coal, or minimum 1200 coal per day, but you will usually get 1600 coal on average. You can also complete daily recurring missions for an additional 400 coal, which will yield you 2000 average coal per day. At this pace, it will take you about 4-5 months to earn enough coal for a T9 premium with a coupon applied.\r\nThere are other ways to get coal. Look out for temporary missions (usually when Brawls are available) and Dockyard stages that reward coal.\r\n\r\nSteel: This is an exclusive resource that you earn via ranked and clan battles. You can earn up to 11000 steel during a CB season, and up to 6200 steel per ranked season.

you should engage enemy DDs at a distance where your ballistics give you the effective DPM advantage, roughly 8+ km\r\n- in the early game, you should contest the nearest cap and, as with other universal type DDs, look at the enemy lineup and make sure you know where enemy radars are - if you don't know where at least one of them is, assume they're at your cap and don't be hasty with capping\r\n- save your engine boost for when you need to run or reposition to another flank, or in rare cases when you\u2019re open water gunboating a lone target (Neustrashimy\u2019s base speed is low so your dodging game needs to be on point)\r\n- in the mid and late game, use your superior conceal to ambush enemy DDs if that\u2019s what it takes to win the game, or resort to farming damage with guns and torps - you may either shoot lone targets from open water, or use smokes to farm when the risk of attracting too much heat is too great\r\n- use your torps often, they reload reasonably quickly and have good damage\r\n- you can use your heals under fire,", "start_char_idx": 14313, "end_char_idx": 18842, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb251ee7-5e79-4d8c-a8e2-17521df863e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb251ee7-5e79-4d8c-a8e2-17521df863e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0255820a-6e1b-4507-b941-952744982214", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1350814d52a65c6c7fb4709bf2834c6da3b6ffcb1c2ce29b8f0ee413e5990c7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a8fedd2-c1c7-4824-95ff-1142b6014f35", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5065a158c00f7b7fd0f8025752cae498d7fcc0e38316a67de955441262599651", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba44d74e-221b-4ac6-b05f-5f3c2aa4841a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eb6fb32af28f413c9db085b7f769a8d28efc835cbc23b7ce84f582cb42eff56c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "as with other universal type DDs, look at the enemy lineup and make sure you know where enemy radars are - if you don't know where at least one of them is, assume they're at your cap and don't be hasty with capping\r\n- save your engine boost for when you need to run or reposition to another flank, or in rare cases when you\u2019re open water gunboating a lone target (Neustrashimy\u2019s base speed is low so your dodging game needs to be on point)\r\n- in the mid and late game, use your superior conceal to ambush enemy DDs if that\u2019s what it takes to win the game, or resort to farming damage with guns and torps - you may either shoot lone targets from open water, or use smokes to farm when the risk of attracting too much heat is too great\r\n- use your torps often, they reload reasonably quickly and have good damage\r\n- you can use your heals under fire, when you\u2019re at about half to 2/3 healing capacity\r\n- even though your AA is miles away from good, you can use your DFAA for \"AA-trapping\" - keep your AA off until enemy planes spot you, then activate your DFAA and use the priority sector as they pass over to the other side of your ship or as they turn around - you will inflict some long-term planelosses and may deter the enemy CV from coming for you again\r\nFR DD guide\r\nEarly game, use solid cover to get close to a cap where you can ambush an enemy DD, lash out in front of the enemy DD and smash them with your reload booster as you turn away and run for the nearest piece of cover. FR DDs are so fast that you can usually pull such things off before the enemy support has time to properly position and react. Always plan your approach so that you end up behind solid cover right after you smash the enemy DD and make sure as few enemy ships as possible can shoot you. If you can't pull that off without losing a lot of HP, you should look to support a friendly DD's cap contest or farm some damage off the enemy while avoiding taking damage.\r\n\r\nAfter that, depending on how the game develops, how many enemies and friendlies are on your flank, and whether there is any cover you can abuse to farm enemies, either go farm the enemy with guns (if you are healthy enough and if there is very few ships that can shoot you) or, preferably, with torps (their damage is much more impactful), try to ambush enemy ships trying to break through, pick off stragglers, yolo-rush ships that are yoloable (FR DDs are some of the best yolo DDs in the game), and try to ambush enemy DDs whenever you have the chance. Use your reload boosters when you have opportunities to deal high amounts of impactful damage, such as when encountering cruiser broadsides, stationary bow-in cruisers and DDs at close range. When fighting enemy DDs, look to create some distance in order to have an advantage in both effective damage output (T8+ FR DD ballistics are some of the best in the game for DDs) as well as dodging.\r\n\r\nIn case there is a USN, RN CV or a Kaga on the game, hold back until you know where he's operating because these can fuck you up real good with HE DBs. In case he's far from your side of the map, proceed to do your usual stuff. If you see an opening, you can attempt to snipe the enemy CV, Kleber is extremely effective at that as long as you approach him while concealed. If the enemy CV is on your side, you can either farm from the safety of friendly AA, go to another cap/flank or look for openings and torp opportunities. Operate around the map borders and try not to get spotted because CVs tend to get hell-bent on killing you.\r\nMarceau specifics\r\n- Marceau is better off farming damage early game unless you can do a really good ambush\r\n- your optimal engagement range against DDs is much shorter due to bad ballistics and extremely high DPM, usually up to 9 km\r\n- your yolo rush options are more limited because your torps do less dmg, but your stealth torping options are better when you get the chance because your torps have longer range and are slower \r\n- you can easily farm dmg from island cover due to your high arcs, but your long range farming is less efficient and overall you do less dmg per game than with Kleber \r\n- don't be fooled by having better AA + DFAA, you still won't stop CV strikes but at least you will shoot down a few more planes\r\nEU DDs (Halland branch)\r\n- the Halland branch DDs have both decent guns and great torps,", "start_char_idx": 17994, "end_char_idx":

to the inability to disengage from unfavourable engagements which mandates high trigger discipline and careful pathing \r\n- only engage enemy DDs in a 1v1 when:\r\n1) you are certain you can outgun them by a fair margin \r\n2) when you are absolutely certain nobody else can interfere and swing the balance in the enemy's favour \r\n3) when your ballistics won\u2019t bring you to a disadvantaged position, which is usually below 9 km\r\n- in other cases, engage guns on larger ships when they\u2019re distracted or when you can abuse island cover\r\n- your torps have low damage but fast reload, high speed and very tight spreads, which makes them quite forgiving\r\n- use the super narrow spreads when you are certain that you will hit your target, like very predictable targets at close distances or bow-in targets, and use the standard narrow spreads when you are torping targets from further away (make sure to overlap them, but not completely)\r\n- nevertheless, make sure your torpedo marksmanship is on point (https://imgur.com/a/SJpbq )\r\n- your job in the early game is to contest caps and throw torps at targets of opportunity\r\n- before you enter a cap, look at the enemy lineup and make sure you know where enemy radars are; if there are radars that are unaccounted for, you have to approach the cap from a direction where you will be able to scout the enemy's radar position or escape quickly from without taking much damage, or drop the cap altogether until enemy radars are accounted for - assume they're at your cap and don't be hasty with capping\r\n- in the mid game, look to keep enemy DDs in check or move to another flank if your flank's enemy side is running away\r\n- in the late game, look to mop up lone targets and out-cap the enemy team\r\n- save your engine boost for when you need to run or reposition to the other side of the map\r\n- you can use your heals early mid-fight so that you have time to make use of its full duration during the fight\r\n- use your DFAA for \"AA-trapping\" - keep your AA off until enemy planes spot you, then activate your DFAA and use the priority sector as they pass over to the other side of your ship or as they turn around\r\n\r\nEU DDs (Gdansk branch)\r\n- these ships are DPS-type gunboats, much like most Soviet DDs; however, the high tier ships bring a spicy short cooldown and short duration radar to the table, which makes these ships\u2019 optimal playstyle a bit different\r\n- in the early game, your job is to delay an enemy DD capping the nearest cap - sit patiently outside the cap but make sure it\u2019s entirely covered by your radar range; once an enemy DD enters the cap, use your radar in order to deal damage to the enemy DD and hopefully chase them away from the cap (don\u2019t expect to kill them due to the radar\u2019s short duration)\r\n- don\u2019t spend all your radars in the early game - save at least 2 charges for the late game in order to be able to damage enemy DDs that are shadowing you in open water\r\n- in the mid game, use your superb guns to farm large amounts of damage, either from open water or from the safety of your smoke\r\n- in the late game, try to clean up any leftover enemy DDs, or keep farming damage\r\n- you torpedoes are an afterthought, use them only in case an enemy is close enough, pushing towards you and you can\u2019t use your guns\r\n- considering their engine boost has a relatively short duration, you should use it more carefully - when under high intensity fire and need to escape, or when you need to get to a point

you smoke up to farm shit, think about whether there's nearby island cover you can use to block line of sight instead\r\n- don't smoke up to farm in pushable positions because you don't have torps and can, as such, be rushed down by anything with higher survivability or DPM\r\n- don't open water gunboat unless you're fighting a lone BB because Friesland is very slow by DD standards and doesn't have engine boost to aid in dodging by acceleration\r\n- use hydro when you either want to make sure you won't eat torps from enemy DDs, or when you want to spot and overpower enemy DDs from within

battery is extremely accurate and your HE shells penetrate 30 mm armor which makes your damage output against larger ships much more potent than raw DPM would suggest, but it also means your gunnery needs to be on point\r\n- your optimal engagement range is 8-13 km - your ballistics are good but you may struggle to hit moving cruisers at max range (and definitely DDs)\r\n- use AP against broadside cruisers and BBs at distances below 10 km, like you would with other CLs\r\n- don\u2019t head straight for caps in the early game, rather assume a good position behind an island or on a flank and wait for enemy ships to start engaging friendlies before you open up; you can also shadow friendly DDs and support their capping operations, but don\u2019t be the first one to get spotted because you will lose too much HP which you will need for the late game\r\n- when you start getting shot at, pop your engine boost and use the superb speed, acceleration and deceleration it provides to dodge enemy fire and increase your survivability\r\n- later on, use your engine boost to reposition to other flanks or engage enemy cruisers in open water combat\r\n- be afraid of cruisers with exceptional ballistics like Moskva, Nevsky, Petro or Venezia, and don\u2019t engage them in direct combat\r\n- later in the game, when the situation demands it, go about mopping up enemy DDs - you can beat any DD except other Ragnars, and Elbings at distances above 10 km; be careful with broadside exposure against German DDs, RN DDs and IJN gunboats\r\n- you can \u201cAA-trap\u201d enemy CVs - wait

ships focusing on you or when changing flanks\r\n- in the mid to late game, focus on farming damage or mopping up enemy DDs if there is a chance you might lose the game\r\n- despite your incredible firepower and survivability, be afraid of cruisers with exceptional ballistics, Marceau, Ragnar, Elbing, Kleber and Khaba; take extra care if you\u2019re engaging DDs with superior ballistics while your engine boost is down because Smaland is not a very hard ship to hit\r\nIT DD guide\r\n- despite what their stats or WG\u2019s recommendations might lead you to believe, these ships are gunboat DPS-type DDs, not torpedoboats\r\n- they have very high damage but short ranged guns that carry HE and SAP shells - you use SAP against anything that gives you enough angle to penetrate, and you use HE against anything that doesn\u2019t\r\n- their playstyle in the early game consists of looking for a position they can ambush an enemy DD from - they can either fly into a cap using their engine boost, burst an enemy DD down and run away using their exhaust smoke, or by popping out from behind an island and doing the same\r\n- your torps have quick reload and long range, so make sure you fling them at targets for chip damage and forcing out DCPs\r\n- in the mid and late game, try to take unguarded caps and burst down larger enemy ships\r\n- since most of these ships have to be in dangerous proximity to large enemy ships in order to use their guns, even with AFT skilled, you will often have to dip in and out of firing range, or open fire while using your engine boost, or resort to farming from smoke\r\n- be extremely wary of Soviet CA/Ls because none of these DDs have enough range to stay outside of their radar, which will mandate that you force their radar before you engage them from within smoke; smart Soviet CA/L players will usually not use their radar unless you're capping while concealed, or unless they've been suddenly spotted in open water\r\n- your optimal engagement range against DDs is basically the further, the better, because of their good ballistics \r\n- these ships aren't particularly fast without their engine boost running so be very careful who

them while they cap with your radar, and engage only when you're already in a kiting stance (use islands near the cap to cover the cap with your radar before you come out of cover)\r\n- in the mid and late game, you should focus on mopping up enemy cruisers, and DDs if they threaten your chances of winning the game\r\n- your optimal engagement range is 11-15 km, even though you can comfortably hit targets at max range (stock max range; please for the love of god don\u2019t use range mod on T9-11)\r\n- try not to get shot and focus on doing damage to DDs, cruisers and BBs, in that order of priority; DM and Buffalo can afford to take some fire because they get a huge upgrade in the form of Repair; the T8 and above USN CAs can bow-tank 380 mm and smaller calibre BBs because their entire hulls are plated in at least 27 mm armour\r\n- if you need to push, don't do it alone and make sure you have hydro up and running when you're sailing towards an enemy DD or when you're in a relatively safe position with a high chance of an enemy DD torping you\r\n- USN CA AP is extremely potent with high DPM and excellent ricochet angles, so you should use it liberally at distances below 14 km, just make sure that the cruiser or BB you're shooting is not too angled for you to penetrate\r\n(pls just don't spam AP at bow-in ships)\r\n- abuse cover often because your ballistics allow you to lob shells over many islands; you can get quite creative with positioning\r\n- specific to Annapolis, use your burst fire mode when 1) you\u2019re disengaging and won\u2019t reengage for at least the next 40 seconds 2) when you see an opportunity to utterly destroy an enemy broadside cruiser, but aren\u2019t forced to continue engaging after emptying your autoloader\r\n\r\nAlaska guide\r\n- your job is smashing enemy broadsides and occasionally defending caps from enemy DDs\r\n- in the early game, take a position that will allow you to catch enemy broadsides and create a crossfire with other big gun ships on your team\r\n- think about using your radar in the early stages only if you can get close enough using island cover, and if you can bail out safely\r\n- as the game progresses, you should attempt to fight at closer ranged and take space from the enemy using your survivability and radar\r\n- in the late game, you may attempt to hunt enemy DDs\r\n- your main ammo type is AP, it is usable for like 2/3 of your play time due to incredibly good ricochet angles (the rule of thumb is, if the enemy can fire all turrets at you, you can use AP - there are very few exceptions to this rule \r\n- swap to HE for stubbornly angled targets that you can't overmatch, or DDs\r\n- your radar is an afterthought, so don't play around trying to make it work - rather use it opportunistically\r\n- your citadel is placed very low in the water, so you may sometimes get away with a \"gamer turn\" without taking too much damage (don't show your broadside deliberately!)\r\nUSN CL guide\r\n- much like USN CAs, your main job in the early game is supporting friendly DDs, but you need to be more careful when going about it because you\u2019re relatively squishy for a cruiser\r\n- also much like USN CAs, aim to deal damage by using island cover; you are more of a DPS cruiser than a utility one because your DPS is higher and the high tiers don\u2019t have quite as much radar range so some radar positions that you can use with the USN CAs won\u2019t work for the CLs\r\n- their optimal engagement distance vs cruisers is below 13 km, and 12-15 km vs BBs (BBs are easier to hit and you need to be at a distance where you can dodge their fire comfortably)\r\n- in the mid to late game, look to hunt enemy DDs down and mop up enemy cruisers with your DPM at close range\r\n- in general, try not to get shot and let the others tank the damage for you\r\n- use HE unless a broadside opens up at very close range (like sub 8 km)\r\n- abuse cover often because your ballistics allow you to lob shells over many islands, but your high shell arcs will also demand high aiming skill from you; you have to be quite creative with your positioning and have good aim in order to get the most out of your damage output\r\n- DFAA and hydro usage is pretty straightforward, use DFAA when a CV commits to a strike on you or a nearby friendly with bombers or TBs,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4327,

shot at, this is best done by using friendlies as meatshields, or avoiding line of sight by using island cover or friendly smokes \r\n- your gameplay will mostly consist of doing damage in bursts when your reload booster is available, with some occasional constant damage output when you can avoid being shot at \r\n- be very careful when engaging because your HP is low and you are highly prone to exploding to enemy BB fire; you also can't really trade with enemy cruisers because of your low HP, unless you manage to catch them broadside while your reload booster is available\r\n- your ideal engagement range is 12-15 km - you need to be far away rough from the enemy to be able to dodge shells, and your ballistics allow you to engage comfortably at that distance\r\n- don't be afraid to engage in open water, but try not to get shot at by more than 2 ships \r\n- dodge by using both steering and deceleration, as your ship and turning circle are both very small and comparable to some large DDs \r\n- use reload boosters when enemies present broadsides or when you really need to outdamage an enemy you're fighting \r\n- don't forget to use your torps when kiting in stealth, they're Fletcher torps and are as such very good\r\nSan Diego guide\r\n- you\u2019re a DPS and fire support ship, your job is to do as much damage as possible while surviving\r\n- unlike Austin, San Diego has quite decent survivability for a T8 CL thanks to her incredible agility, good concealment and Repair, which is sadly unavailable to most T8 CA/Ls - this means you can take fights with enemy cruisers and BBs in open water\r\n- SAP is your primary ammo, whereas AP should only be used against broadsides at close range that you wouldn\u2019t be able to penetrate with SAP (citadel belts at very close range, upper belts with more than 36 mm plating); if an enemy is heavily armored and too far away for AP to be effective, use SAP against their superstructure\r\n- in the early game, stick close to friendly DDs and support them while they cap, and in return they might thank you with providing you a smoke (don't count on it, though)\r\n- in the mid and late game, look to destroy enemy cruisers at medium and close range - you have a repair which means you will outtrade a lot of T8 cruisers at your optimal engagement range (10-14 km)\r\n- you can also try sneaking around islands and ambushing enemy DDs in the late game\r\n- keep a bit further away from BBs in order to be able to dodge their fire in a timely manner\r\n- consumable use is straightforward, use hydro if you expect torpedoes and use DFAA against incoming planes\r\n- use reload boosters against targets you can guarantee large amounts of penetrating hits on, such as broadside cruisers and DDs\r\nIJN CA guide\r\n- your primary role is that of a stealthy, kiting DPS cruiser that excels at supporting friendly DDs\r\n- the best strategy for the early game is to shadow a friendly DD by keeping some 5-7 km behind them, so that they're the first ones to spot an enemy DD and get spotted before you do\r\n- don't open fire before your ship is angled away from the enemy - once you're properly angled and kiting, slap the enemy DD with your superbly accurate guns\r\n- these ships are exceptionally accurate, so your aim needs to be on point, and this also means you will have less stray shells hitting if you narrowly miss your target\r\n- in the mid and late game, look to do damage to enemy cruisers and BBs\r\n- their ideal engagement range is 11-14 km,", "start_char_idx": 3527, "end_char_idx": 7959,

thick decks that allow them to bounce BB AP, unlike most of their peers (Mogami, Ibuki and Zao don't have that luxury so you will have to resort to dodging in order to avoid damage)\r\n- keep large enemy ships or DDs whose positions you know about about your detection range's distance worth away, and learn when to disengage (don't overstay your welcome); re-engage when the enemy shift their attention to friendly ships\r\n- use AP against broadside cruisers and HE against everything else\r\n- if the enemy is pushing into you, try flinging your torps at them (keep in mind the poor torpedo launcher arcs)\r\n- use hydro over DFAA because you won't meet CVs every game and your AA isn't very good\r\nTone specifics\r\n- not quite like the typical IJN CA not only because of planes, but because she doesn't have their typically strong deck armour or gun power\r\n- the way to go about playing Tone is similar to IJN CAs in the way that you support friendly DDs while they cap in the early game, and your gameplay mostly consists of kiting and doing dmg (see the IJN CA guide for more details on this part)\r\n- her optimal engagement range is a bit different, 12-15 km, as you need to put more emphasis on surviving\r\n- when fighting enemy DDs you want to be some 10 km away in order to maximise your chances of hitting them, and at such a distance you will usually be far away enough to dodge BB fire\r\n- use your torps as you would with other IJN CAs\r\n- how to use planes:\r\nwhen you need to spot an enemy DD nearby for your teammates and yourself to shoot, you can hover above them, strike and cancel the animation with a double click for a chance to shoot him yourself while he's still spotted\r\ndoing damage to enemy ships while you can't engage them with guns for any reason, and preferably to ships that have their DCP on cooldown \r\nspotting any enemy ship in cases where you're not in a position to engage, and when spotting the enemy for some time will have a greater impact than simply attacking them\r\ndon't use them on cooldown because their cooldown is rather long and their damage is rather weak\r\ntry to attack isolated targets because the planes' HP is low\r\nKitakami guide\r\n- at the start of the game, pop engine boost assume a flank position and shoot your first torp payload into the enemy spawn, or wherever enemy BBs are most likely to go in early game\r\n- avoid caps in order to avoid getting your ship or torps spotted by the enemy DD\r\n- if you manage to get spotted, are in a position to dodge, and aren't targeted by too many enemies, don't blow your smoke immediately and rather resort to dodging\r\n- otherwise, pop smoke, especially if an enemy CV is riding you\r\n- prioritise targeting BBs, then cruisers\r\n- don't fire your torps on cooldown, rather have 2 or 3 launchers ready before you strike\r\n- don't have all your tubes loaded either, it's a sign you're mispositioning and/or wasting time\r\n- if you have a lot of tubes loaded, fire 2 at a time in order to try and force DCP to cause follow-up floods\r\n- you can use smoke to farm damage with guns in end game situations or when you are sure you will not need the

Hipper and Eugen) some of the best damage dealers in the game across most tiers due to their high penetration HE shells, good range, ballistics, HE DPM and high AP damage\r\n- early game, do as you would with other DPS cruisers - support friendly DDs in caps while in a kiting stance and do poke damage to larger enemy ships while trying not to lose HP; your optimal engagement range is 12-17

damage them\r\n- it is especially important to avoid being shot at when playing K\u00f6nigsberg and N\u00fcrnberg because they are extremely vulnerable to BB AP - they have high shell arcs so you can use a lot of islands to block line of sight while being able to shoot over them\r\n- use AP against broadside cruisers and BBs (except German BBs, Soyuz and Kremlin due to their very thick upper belts) under 15 km\r\n- forget about using torpedoes unless you're in a situation where you can close the distance against a torpedo-less ship using island cover and pump their face full of torps\r\n- consumable usage is quite straightforward, use hydro when under threat of being torped and use your spotter plane when you lack range to hit something or when you want to spot something over an island at close range; forget about using DFAA because your AA isn\u2019t very good and the consumable itself is quite situational\r\n\r\nMainz specifics\r\n- most of the above points apply to Mainz, with the following differences:\r\nuse AP against broadsides at short ranges, mostly below 10 km, or against weakly armoured ships out to 13 km\r\nMainz\u2019s ballistics are more floaty than on the 203 mm armed cruisers, so you will have more opportunities to block line of sight by using island or smoke cover - constantly think about where you can position to block LoS\r\nyour optimal engagement range is shorter, about 11-16 km\r\nVMF CL guide\r\n- Nevsky and co are primarily utility cruisers due to their long range radar and good conceal to radar buffer, with the lower tier cruisers being decent ranged DPS cruisers due to their good range and ballistics\r\n- in the early game, find an island you can use to cover your approach to a cap and turn out as you come out from behind it, then use radar as you're spotted and get some damage on the enemy DD\r\n- in the mid game, spam HE from range (prioritise cruisers as your targets) and, if possible, radar enemy DDs when you have the chance, but don't go out of your way to do so because these ships are not very tanky and you really don't want to be stuck bow in and perma spotted with them\r\n- in the late game, mop up any enemy DDs and finish off low HP targets\r\n- try not to get stuck behind islands because your ballistics are quite flat, which means you will mostly play in open water\r\n- your optimal engagement range is 12-16 km for the 152 mm armed CLs, and 14-18 km for Donskoi and Nevsky \r\n- don't forget to use your AP against broadsides, Nevsky and Donskoi retain very good pen at range\r\n- be very careful when getting shot at by enemy BBs, especially ones with a large number of 380-420 mm guns because Nevsky is a very large CL and as such has large 25 mm sides\r\n- only use torps as a last resort weapon in close

CA guide (the Novosibirsk branch)\r\n- they are very simple to play, you\u2019re primarily a tank cruiser with some utility in the form of a short duration long range radar\r\n- early game, you try to radar enemy DDs because your max concealment allows you to radar almost as soon as you are spotted, provided you are moving forward - do it in a manner that will get you behind cover or where you appear from around an island corner in a kiting stance; don\u2019t expect much damage and team supporting fire because, again, your radar lasts for a very short time\r\n- later on you go about kiting and tanking, looking for broadsides to exploit or sneaking into positions that allow you to set up crossfires - Riga and Petro excel at punishing sides, but are pretty much useless against angled ships \r\n- these ships have a unique dispersion pattern that is very tight at close range but gets really inaccurate at distances greater than 14 km, which makes their optimal engagement distance 'as close as possible'\r\n- despite what stories you might have heard about their AP, these ships\u2019 primary ammo is still HE as their AP has barely improved penetration angles - you will not do yourself any favours if you keep spamming AP at bow-in ships\r\n- if there aren\u2019t many ships that can focus you down, you can try making plays by hopping from island to island and exerting pressure on enemy ships or getting into angles that will force crossfires on the enemy\r\n- their guns perform poorly past 14 km because of their crappy dispersion; still, you should look for broadsides to punish at any range because of the amazing AP penetration \r\n- when playing Riga and Novosibirsk, be very careful when bringing your back turret to a firing solution because their citadels are very vulnerable and their turrets\u2019 maximum firing angles are within ricochet margins for most AP shells in the game\r\n\r\nRN CL guide\r\n- their role is DPS and close DD support, or, if you decide to pick radar on high tier ships, you assist DDs in contesting and prevent objectives from being taken\r\n- keep in mind RN CLs are not very newb-friendly because they don't have HE, which means you need to have some knowledge of armour schemes and ricochet mechanics (these shells have improved ricochet angles) in order to use AP to its fullest extent - learn which ships have thick upper belt armour, and learn the ranges and angles at which you can penetrate it (in case you can\u2019t penetrate upper belts or the enemy has angled their ship too much, aim for the

to disengage\r\n- if you have equipped radar on your Edinburgh, Minotaur and Edgar (not recommended for Neptune due to large hull and subpar concealment), keep the following things in mind:\r\nyou obviously can't use smoke to disengage and farm damage, so you have to shift your focus to using islands or resorting to open water engagements with mad dodging skills if you want to rack up damage numbers\r\nyour main role with radar is to control cap zones and make enemy DDs' lives miserable, farming damage is only a matter of opportunity\r\nin order to win fights against cruisers and BBs, you either have to take 1v1 fights or unfair fights where their attention is taken up by something else, or when somebody else is spotting for you while you hide and do damage\r\nyou will find that you

conceal to get closer and assume a kiting stance - make sure your detection range doesn't exceed the enemy's edge of the nearest cap so you don't get spotted by a DD before you turn away \r\n- in the mid and late game, look to out-trade enemy cruisers or farm damage off BBs while dodging their fire - your optimal engagement range is 13+ km because it will allow you to effectively dodge enemy

other cruisers > everything else \r\n- use your engine boost when you are under fire so you can dodge both by acceleration and deceleration as well as steering \r\n- use your reload booster when you find broadside cruisers, cruisers at relatively close range, and BBs that had just used DCP, in order to set multiple fires\r\n- if an enemy cruiser presents their broadside and you have the wrong

which will enable you to survive and have shots at their sides\r\n- in order to do this effectively, you need good map knowledge and you need to use islands to be able to disengage when needed -

doesn\u2019t allow you to do this, roam around, pay real good attention to the minimap, take opportunistic shots at broadsides and look for opportunities to get on the enemy\u2019s side\r\n- don\u2019t be afraid to swap to HE if there are no broadside targets available, but always be ready to swap back to AP; you may unload AP into the enemy\u2019s superstructure if you already have it loaded and want to swap to HE for the next volley\r\n- if you notice a broadside present itself and you have the wrong ammo type loaded, use the Loader skill and your reload booster to quickly swap to AP and punish the enemy for their mistake\r\n- these ships are best played at 13-16 km from the nearest large enemy ship because that distance allows you to effectively dodge cruiser and BB fire by accelerating and decelerating while your engine boost is running; however, your accuracy is subpar for a battlecruiser which means you will be quite ineffective if you keep shooting at targets at max

with the main difference from the others being that they have high damage SAP shells and full throttle (\u201cfuel\u201d) smokes\r\n- in the early game, you should be in a kiting stance, looking to blap an enemy DD - you do this by keeping some 6-7 km behind a friendly DD as you expect them to spot an enemy DD for you to shoot, and you don't break your cover before you spot an enemy DD\r\n- SAP damage is very high which means you can slap enemy DDs for 1/3-1/2 of their HP in a single volley, provided they're broadside\r\n-after the early-game, look to do damage to enemy cruisers and lightly armoured BBs\r\n- use SAP 90% of the time, except when you have an opportunity to guarantee citadels on an enemy cruiser or when you have nothing better to shoot than a heavily armoured BB (like a German one)\r\n- be sure to launch your torps often, at enemies pushing towards you, as their long range allows you to get an occasional hit for extra dmg\r\n- be extra wary of enemy DDs and other ships with long range torpedoes as these ships don't have access to hydro\r\n- use smokes to either prolong your survival or eliminate the risk of getting slapped or killed while doing otherwise dangerous moves, like traversing gaps where you are sure to get spotted or making 180\u00b0 turns in situations where you managed to fuck up and get permanently spotted while bow in\r\n- when using smokes, always keep your smoke firing penalty in mind and have high trigger discipline\r\nNapoli specifics\r\n- the above points apply, except you don\u2019t have SAP and can\u2019t do anywhere near

in punishing stationary ships with airstrikes\r\n- don\u2019t get too aggressive in the early game just to get your airstrikes off ASAP - instead, play as you would with other DPS cruisers - support DDs, get into favourable kiting positions, kite and do damage to enemy ships from a safe distance and position\r\n- your optimal engagement range with the low tier ships is 11-14 km, and 11-16 km starting at Haarlem; if you use the range mod on Gouden Leeuw, your guns can be quite effective all the way out to max range\r\n- once some enemy ship pushes up to an aggressive position, you can start bombarding them with airstrikes - you need to aim your airstrikes as if you were shooting an enemy some 20 km away with your guns\r\n- you can also use airstrikes to slap ships that are moving predictably, preferably with their bow towards or away from you\r\n- be careful when fighting other cruisers with high tier NL CA because they have battlecruiser fire duration (for god knows what reason), and because they have low effective damage output with their guns due to low DPM and poor dispersion; you have fast cooldown Repairs that allow you to offset that fire duration, but you will burn through them very quickly if you're not careful\r\n- use hydro and DFAA as you would on other cruisers\r\nES CA guide\r\n- these ships are primarily kiting DPS cruisers whose gameplay is spiced up by the burst fire mechanic\r\n- the gameplay loop is similar to most DPS cruisers in the early game - shadow a friendly DD to support their capping operation, or take up a kiting position and start doing damage to larger enemy ships\r\n- the burst fire mechanic comes into play when you have an opportunity to burst an enemy DD that is moving very predictably (such as mid-turning away after being spotted), or when you catch a broadside enemy cruiser; the low tiers benefit from this mechanic less than the high tiers because of its very long reload time and their mediocre ballistics, so use this ability carefully because you will be punished for using it poorly\r\n- the high tiers are well suited for flanking and medium to long range combat due to their high speed, good range, great ballistics and access to the spotter plane - their optimal engagement range is 12-17 km; the lower tiers\u2019 optimal engagement range is 10-15 km\r\n\r\nPan-Asian CL guide\r\n- these ships are

extremely wary of any DDs in the vicinity as you don\u2019t have hydro so you have to angle against the most likely direction of incoming torps\r\nPan-American CL guide\r\n- these ships are primarily tank/DPS CLs with an emphasis on using their Combat instructions to make the best use of their myriad consumables\r\n- the main idea behind playing these ships is sustaining fire on the enemy in order to fill up their Combat instructions bar, before making aggressive plays that use the consumable cooldown reduction that the Combat instructions provide in conjunction with their extremely powerful Repair in order to survive high intensity combat\r\n- in the early game, you should take positions on the flanks and wait for enemy ships to push or have multiple targets within your range before you start engaging in order to be able to sustain fire on the enemy for long enough and fill your Combat instructions up\r\n- once your Combat instructions are ready to activate, you can start looking for more intense engagements, either at close range or against larger numbers of enemy ships\r\n- your optimal engagement range is 12 km to max range in case your Combat instructions are not ready, and 10-14 km in case they are ready\r\n- also think about positioning in places that allow you to create crossfires with allied ships, in order to hit the enemy\u2019s sides (as you only have AP shells)\r\n- much like RN CLs, these ships only have access to AP shells with improved ricochet angles, so similar rules apply: learn which ships have thick upper belt armour, and learn the ranges and angles at which you can penetrate it (in case you can\u2019t penetrate upper belts or the enemy has angled their ship too much, aim for the superstructure)\r\n- the spotter plane is the preferred consumable choice on all ships except the San Martin, where Radar becomes a viable alternative - the reason for this is the relatively high conceal to radar range difference on Allende and Santander\r\n- as far as consumable usage is concerned, standard rules apply: use your Hydro when you suspect enemy is launching torps at you, and use your Repair when it reaches max capacity, when you are close to dying, or, in case it\u2019s not near max capacity, if you are under very intense fire", "start_char_idx": 32564, "end_char_idx": 36729, "text_template":

Battleship guides, Common BB guide\r\n- in the early game, sneak up to support a cap and make sure your detection range does not exceed the enemy's side of the nearest cap, then turn out and assume a kiting stance\r\n- you can take potshots in the meantime if you see an opportunity to punish a broadside, but be sure to conceal yourself before you turn out so you don't get punished yourself\r\n- alternate between reverse and 1/2 forward speed while keeping yourself well angled towards enemy BBs (make sure you're heavily angled but can fire all turrets on your target) and provide fire support\r\n- if you start attracting too much focus (3+ ships shooting you) or if the enemy starts to push, start running and try to get somebody else to take over some of the focus fire\r\n- don't blow your DCP on the first fire that gets set on you unless you are at minimum risk of catching another fire (as in somebody just took a potshot at you with HE without really focusing you)\r\n- tank the first fires with your heal, then pull back a bit so you can disengage (when you blow a DCP on fires your detection range drops back to its minimum state, but make sure the detection debuff after firing isn't in place)\r\n- rinse and repeat\r\n- in the mid and late game, look to either assume aggressive positioning on your flank if you have the numerical and/or HP advantage, or kite away and look to apply pressure elsewhere if needed\r\n- for maximum game impact, your target priority should be DDs > broadside cruisers > cruisers you can overmatch > broadside BBs; do note that you should not pull shots at DDs at distances further than 14-15 km, or past whichever range you feel comfortable shooting them at\r\n- your optimal engagement range differs depending on which BB branch you\u2019re playing - for USN, FR and RN BBs, it\u2019s usually 13-18 km, a bit further away for IJN BBs, and a bit closer for Italian, Soviet and German BBs\r\n- if you have nothing to shoot, you can try using your spotter plane and taking potshots across the map into broadsides of enemy ships on the opposite flank (aka crossfire)\r\n- use HE only when you're guaranteed to be shooting a DD with your next volley, or if there is a stubbornly bow-in BB that you can't overmatch, with nothing else to shoot (don't swap to HE from fully loaded guns, just fire the loaded AP into the enemy BB's superstructure instead)\r\n- this guide applies to most BB branches, with each of the specific branches\u2019 peculiarities covered below\r\nUSN slow BB specifics (Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Vermont)\r\n- all of the above +:\r\n- look to position around the wider map centre - this will compensate for your low speed and allow you to prevent being outrun or overrun by the enemy\r\n- don\u2019t bother swapping to HE because your reload is god awfully long which means an optimal target for AP might show up by the time you load HE\r\n- with Kansas, Minnesota and Vermont, it may be beneficial to stagger your volleys (hold half your shots for about half your reload time) when shooting at angled cruisers because it forces them to keep their angle in fear of getting smashed for a lot of damage, in case they want to turn and show their broadside\r\n- keep in mind the excellent concealment and rapid Repair cooldown of these ships - it allows you to position closer to the enemy and dictate engagements against enemy BBs and some large cruisers\r\n\r\nOhio and Massachusetts specifics\r\n- these ships play differently from most other USN BBs because they have rapid cooldown repairs and decent secondary armament\r\n- like most other BBs, you should start off by playing them at range, but you should aim to use islands to close the distance with the enemy later on in the game\r\n- look for 1v1 fights against enemy BBs, you will win most of them handily because of your rapid repairs and additional fires set by your secondaries\r\n- if you have the CQC skill on your captain (which you should), you can activate it by having enemy ships within your secondary range but out of your line of sight (aka putting an island between yourself and them) to buff your main battery reload and shoot at far away targets\r\nGeorgia\r\n- despite having similarly strong secondaries and rapid repair like Ohio and Massachusetts, Georgia should not play around brawling due to her guns simply being way too good at long range, and her being relatively less survivable than Ohio or Massa\r\n- you should get into secondary range opportunistically, in mid to end-game situations

targets further than that if you are confident in your aim, or if you are shooting at BBs\r\n- if you can, let other tougher BBs take the punishment while you dish out damage\r\n- she inherits the USN CA improved ricochet angles, so use her AP quite liberally; other than that, her ammo selection follows the standard rules for USN CAs (and most other CAs)\r\n- when playing this ship, you should also consider her floaty ballistics as an advantage - you can use islands to your advantage more liberally than with any other BB\r\n- overall, in order to have a similar impact as most of your peers, you should be doing much more damage than with other T9 BBs because, again, you\u2019re not a long range threat\r\nHybrid USN BB specifics \r\n- these ships ideally want to play at 15-18 km away from the enemy in the early game because they take lots of damage to their enormous flight deck hitboxes\r\n- their ballistics are subpar by BB standards, so you also want to be at that distance because it allows you to launch planes without losing too much (if any) gun DPM \r\n- use planes against enemies that are within 16-ish km, either right after you've fired a volley so you can fire the next one immediately after you get your plane payload off, or, if you want to shoot an enemy DD, have your guns loaded or close to loaded before you launch planes so that you can promptly shoot the enemy as you initiate the attack animation\r\n- don't use planes if you are under a lot of pressure and have to constantly manoeuvre and evade - if necessary, you can manoeuvre to a certain degree using the autopilot, but as well know the autopilot is very wonky and unreliable \r\n- in case of Kearsarge, you have to skip the animation and miss the DD deliberately because the planes can\u2019t spot and strike the enemy DD at the same time (unless spotted by other means)\r\n- make sure to always double click when you fire your payload so that you immediately skip the attack animation and reassume control of your ship\r\n- don\u2019t push with these ships because, again, they take lots of damage, and instead let tougher friendly BBs take the beating for you - your job is fire and air support\r\nIJN BB specifics\r\n- your role in battle is medium to long range tanking and fire support (with the exception of Fuso which is more suited for medium range)\r\n- your optimal engagement range is a bit higher than that of other BBs due to your distinct accuracy advantage at range (15 km+)\r\n- IJN BB HE is trash unless you\u2019re playing Fuso and Hyuga, so stick to AP\r\n- never try

don't expose yourself to a German or USN premium BB inside his secondary range, and instead try to engage him from a distance of 12-15 km in order to negate his secondary battery advantage; also don't commit when there's an enemy CV that can nuke you out of the water for free, rather stick with your team and play the anchor position;

If you are looking for, or fighting enemy submarines, or have to dive to avoid being detected by surface ships, planes or hydroacoustics, dive to maximum depth. Note that anti-sub and anti-surface hydrophone can both spot you at periscope depth. Do keep in mind that hydro will still spot you if you\u2019re at 2 km or less from the ship using it, at any depth.\r\n\r\nYou should always be thinking about if you can \u201cshotgun\u201d an enemy ship. \u201cShotgunning\u201d is using torps at close range against ships that are either stationary or moving towards you. Approach them from periscope depth and try to launch your torps close to the 3 km mark. Unguided torpedoes do only 10% of their listed damage within 2.9 km of being fired - considering the sizes of ships in-game and the fact that the in-game listed distances between ships are calculated from their middle point, you have to launch your torps from a bit further away - 3 km of listed in-game distance usually does the trick. It gets trickier if you\u2019re firing at ships moving towards you and it depends a lot on their speed and heading. If you\u2019ve acquired an enemy at close range, don't ping the enemy with sonar because it will tell them where you're coming from which will give them a chance to prepare. Don't use shotgunning against tightly packed blobs of ships, and keep in mind that you will certainly take some damage from follow-up airstrikes if you get spotted. You should usually not attempt to use unguided torps against targets at range because you will almost certainly miss. This is a good idea only when: the enemy is being very predictable and you are almost certain that your torps will catch them; you are at very low HP and do not want to risk the enemy sending ASW airstrikes your way; you are playing the I-56 or the Gato.\r\nYou can also use unguided torps against targets that are moving away, but you have to aim the torps slightly short of the lead indicator because you have to assume the enemy will turn away to dodge. Aim at where the enemy\u2019s stern would be relative to the lead indicator.\r\nWhen shotgunning a DD, you should make sure that you kill them on the first pass so that you don\u2019t get depth charged. Considering the damage reduction below 3 km, killing DDs with shotgunning can be pretty difficult.\r\nYou can also \u201cshotgun\u201d using homing torps at close range from a 30 m depth. Approach the enemy at the shallowest max depth setting, almost dive to periscope depth, have the enemy pinged beforehand (your torps will immediately go on an ascending course) and unload torps some 1.5-2 km away from the target. If you don\u2019t want to thread the line between periscope and max depth, you should be at least some 3 km away. This requires the target to be spotted by your teammates. The game will warn you whether your torpedoes can ascend in time to hit your target.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse homing torps against enemies that are far away or moving away from you. Don't be hasty while launching homing torps - enemy ships can eliminate the ping by using DCP when they spot torps and completely avoid them by changing course if they're properly angled. To counteract this, and assuming you\u2019re at close range, ping the enemy and launch only half of your torpedoes, then stagger the launch of the remaining torps by about half a minute. Sometimes you can also launch all your torps in several directions and apply homing after waiting a bit in order to have the torpedoes come at the enemy from different directions, making them harder to evade. In case you\u2019re far away from your target, you should just dump all your torpedoes at them - by the time they reach the target and the target uses DCP you will probably have a fresh set reloaded.\r\nDon\u2019t ping more than absolutely necessary, and move sideways at max speed in relation to the enemy in order to maximise your chances of avoiding airstrikes. Also change your heading often, if you can. Double pings are usually not necessary and you should only aim to apply double pings against targets that used DCP and when the first ping has been sticking for a while (the timing depends on how reliably you can hit your pings).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4457, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "812cd740-d2ec-4f8f-a4bf-28dc2c8f8240": {"__data__": {"id_": "812cd740-d2ec-4f8f-a4bf-28dc2c8f8240", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6309ed2-c704-45d2-a479-95f3229553c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0cbdf51a0493cf184700a2eb5fc33cb2f18885733fffb706e34e12be63073e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1629230-bebf-4729-a2e5-4f9765be602b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b2fd4d1cc00417966f89a0539eb96c471f1e886665db68526da7990299c9481", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bfa58f5-3bd9-42ab-b7af-b4a5ce1576ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0cd049707c6fc039e2ed5377ad04e6c3caaf0ef17b18974e045b33ea6ba79cd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sometimes you can also launch all your torps in several directions and apply homing after waiting a bit in order to have the torpedoes come at the enemy from different directions, making them harder to evade.

Double pings are usually not necessary and you should only aim to apply double pings against targets that used DCP and when the first ping has been sticking for a while (the timing depends on how reliably you can hit your pings).\r\nYou can abuse the homing mechanic to bait the enemy into angling against your ping direction while your torps come in from the side. Keep in mind that using torps like this reduces their range (torpedoes mechanically travel for a set amount of time, not a set amount of distance from the launch point!) because of the longer distance they have to traverse when turning, so beware when doing that near the maximum of their range.\r\nExercise caution when using homing torps against blobs of enemy ships as your sonar ping effects will reveal your approximate position and attract ASW airstrikes.\r\nYou can also do underwater shotgunning. Approach the enemy at the shallowest max depth setting, almost dive to periscope depth, have the enemy pinged beforehand so your torps can start ascending ASAP and unload torps from an appropriate distance from the target. This requires the target to be spotted by your teammates.\r\nYou can also launch torps at multiple targets by pinging one target, launching a few torps at them, clearing the target lock for subsequently launched torpedoes (G key by default), and then pinging another target and launching some more torps at them. The torps that are homing in on the first target will remain on their target course, but you shouldn\u2019t forget to refresh the ping if it\u2019s about to expire. Keep in mind that trying to hit multiple targets will require you to ping more, thus attracting more attention and ASW strikes to you. Only use this when you\u2019re trying to burn the DCP of multiple targets.\r\nWhen pinging, move sideways and change course often in order to avoid ASW planes dropped by enemies guesstimating your position based on your sonar ping visual effect, and, in case they hit you, by the oil spill effects they caused.\r\n\r\nAs far as deck guns are concerned, don\u2019t ever think about using them unless you have an opportunity to finish off a very low HP target at close range, in situations when their allies can\u2019t follow up with airstrikes or gunfire.\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re spotted, start manoeuvring and look out for enemy ASW planes. Keep track of the last inbound plane and use DCP only as their depth charges are about to detonate in order to avoid a full duration flood and oil spills that will give your position away. German submarines are especially unforgiving in this regard as their DCP only lasts for 5 seconds, as opposed to the 15 second duration commonly found on other submarines. Also, be very careful and try not to get spotted often because your DCP charges are limited and you will want to use them sparsely.\r\n\r\nWhenever you take damage, an oil spill will appear if you\u2019re underwater. Oil spills appear on the surface and give your exact position away to the enemy, in intervals. They can be cleared by using DCP, or by surfacing.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re having trouble navigating underwater due to low visibility, press the horn keybind (N by default) in order to send out a sonar visual that will mark underwater terrain.\r\n\r\nEarly game, the first thing you should do is switch flanks in order to avoid having to fight the enemy submarine that will spawn opposite your spawn position. Look to pick off stragglers and try to assist friendly DDs by torping what they spot. Look to play closer to the map centre because submarines are quite slow and the enemy may outrun you or run you over if you are positioned poorly. You can avoid enemy DDs (and subs, in case they\u2019re surfaced or at periscope depth) by diving to periscope depth and using your Hydrophone in order to mark their positions (this will not work if you are fully surfaced!). Avoid fighting enemy subs because it will tell the enemy where you are, thus eliminating your element of surprise, and induce follow-up airstrikes on you.

Look to play closer to the map centre because submarines are quite slow and the enemy may outrun you or run you over if you are positioned poorly. You can avoid enemy DDs (and subs, in case they\u2019re surfaced or at periscope depth) by diving to periscope depth and using your Hydrophone in order to mark their positions (this will not work if you are fully surfaced!). Avoid fighting enemy subs because it will tell the enemy where you are, thus eliminating your element of surprise, and induce follow-up airstrikes on you. If your submarine has excellent dive time, like the Germans, you can even dive below the enemy at max depth and slip past them completely undetected, and you can then shotgun an unsuspecting enemy from the back. Don\u2019t try blind-pinging enemy DDs heading for caps. Even though it may inconvenience them when your torps reach them, as well as marking their position on the minimap and revealing which particular DD it is, it also lets the enemy know there\u2019s a submarine in the vicinity and, in case an enemy equipped with airstrikes is in range, it may attract unwanted airstrikes. \r\n\tIn order to avoid being ambushed by enemy DDs, you can use the Hydrophone. Its detection range is usually long enough for you to pre-emptively use it when expecting an enemy DD to close in on a cap zone, enabling you to avoid being spotted by them in a timely manner.\r\nMid and late game, look to secure kills and grab unguarded caps. You should look to deal damage by shotgunning enemy ships with unguided torps from point blank range, or torping them with homing torps from outside of your detection range if they're kiting. Always prioritise shotgunning for maximum impact. Shotgunning is particularly risky vs DDs because of their high agility and the torpedo damage reduction below 3 km, which makes it easy to mess up the launch. Don't try to shotgun-torp DDs that are moving away because they may also heavily damage you with DCs if you follow them. When playing USN subs, this tactic is particularly risky because you may run out of battery very quickly as they don't have the battery consumable like the Germans do, but in turn you will be able to deal more damage in a single pass because USN subs have more torps with higher damage.\r\n\r\nPositioning-wise, you want to be close to the map centre and avoid island-heavy areas because you (obviously) can't lob torps over islands. Try to isolate and shotgun lone enemy ships if you can, otherwise torp them with homing torps from a distance.\r\n\r\nSub v sub encounters are relatively quick and usually result in one of the subs dying. In order to ensure a hit on an enemy sub, launch your torpedoes at least their DCP duration\u2019s worth of time apart (15 seconds; 5 seconds in case of German tech tree subs) in order to avoid the enemy sub mitigating your entire salvo at once. If you want to avoid homing torps as a submarine, you need to use DCP and change your heading - if you are diving or ascending, stop, and vice versa. If DCP is unavailable, move at full speed angled at some 15-20\u00b0 to the enemy's torps and turn hard in the opposite direction when the torps are some 300 m away from you in order to maximise the chances of them whiffing past you. In general, try to avoid fighting enemy subs in the early and mid game because it will force you to go underwater, drain your battery which means you may not have enough left for the late game, and attract unwanted ASW. Lingering at periscope depth is the best way to avoid having to fight enemy subs, but it\u2019s not something you should usually do because of battery drain.\r\nDealing with CVs is very tedious. Subs have no AA which means they have to dive to max depth in order to avoid air spotting, and they also have to wait a whole minute between the first time they ping an enemy CV and the next opportunity to lock torps onto them because CV DCP is dumb and lasts for 60 s. The best way to deal with this is to ping the CV as soon as you spot them in order to force their auto DCP, and then launch your torps at them after some 30 s so you can lock onto the CV when the torps close in on them. Also make sure that you stay outside the CV's auto-ASW range because it will utterly destroy you if you keep pinging from within its range.\r\n\r\nDepth management is also quite important.", "start_char_idx": 7587, "end_char_idx": 11967, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3736d4ea-aadd-45e3-9668-99d5c7140f55": {"__data__": {"id_": "3736d4ea-aadd-45e3-9668-99d5c7140f55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6309ed2-c704-45d2-a479-95f3229553c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0cbdf51a0493cf184700a2eb5fc33cb2f18885733fffb706e34e12be63073e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bfa58f5-3bd9-42ab-b7af-b4a5ce1576ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0cd049707c6fc039e2ed5377ad04e6c3caaf0ef17b18974e045b33ea6ba79cd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a8e4a1e-b0f8-4bad-99d5-3bc80fca07f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "922f54e703f9a55b935d02f92c2ce5d3681ef9466e0308aabf54b038ea7bdd02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Dealing with CVs is very tedious.

Linger at the surface if you are not in danger of being spotted.\r\n\r\nWhen you pass to periscope depth, your detection will gradually decrease.\r\n\r\nPeriscope depth: minimum detection range, you spot enemies at their air detection range, you can be spotted by hydro at full range, hydrophone takes bearing on you. This is the best depth to avoid being spotted by ships.\r\n\r\nMax depth: you can't be spotted by anything other than anti-sub hydrophone, or hydroacoustics at 2 km or less from the enemy using it. This is the depth where you fight subs and avoid most methods of spotting.\r\n\r\nConsumable usage:\r\nDCP: wait for the enemy to unload all their ASW onto you, then use DCP to clear any DoT, disabled modules and oil spills.\r\n\r\nHydrophone: use it preemptively when you suspect an enemy DD is heading for the same cap zone that you are (or whenever you suspect an enemy DD might be close by). Also use it when diving and you suspect an enemy might be right on top of you, in order to avoid being detected and ASW\u2019d.\r\n\r\nSub surveillance: use it when trying to fight enemy subs (duh). You can also use it while you\u2019re on the surface in order to inconvenience an enemy sub and spot them for your team. This is especially useful when the enemy sub is in close proximity to your allies, and, as such, they can\u2019t surface for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nOther consumables are covered in branch-specific guides below.\r\nUSN subs\r\nyou should look to deal damage from a distance because your battery capacity is low and your torps reload 2 by 2 per group\r\nwhen attacking enemy ships with homing torpedoes or from a distance, you can first use your bow launchers, then turn tails to the enemy in order to use the stern ones and thus maximise DPM\r\nwhen shotgunning, you can shotgun the enemy with your bow launchers, dive below them and emerge on the other side and shotgun them again with your aft launchers, but you have to do it with a lot of battery charge in order to avoid getting stuck in the enemy backline and getting obliterated by ASW\r\nuse your dive consumable when you need to crash-dive to avoid enemy fire or to improve your manoeuvrability when you are fighting enemy subs\r\nGato\r\nher gameplay consists mostly of running around at periscope depth and using her unguided torps at short range\r\nif you have to chase, don\u2019t be afraid of trying to hit enemy ships at long range with your unguided torps, they reload very quickly for the damage that they do\r\nonly use homing torps if you are forced to fight a highly manoeuvrable target at close range\r\nunlike the tech tree subs, you want to do hit-and-run attacks at periscope depth instead of shotgunning by diving under the enemy because of your high surface and periscope speed and low underwater speed\r\nuse your dive consumable when you need to crash-dive to avoid enemy fire or to improve your manoeuvrability when you are fighting enemy subs\r\nGerman subs\r\nthey're better suited for close range combat due to their good detection range and very high battery longevity\r\nthe best strategy with these subs is to play around shotgunning - your high battery capacity allows you to stay underwater for very long periods of time and throw torps from unexpected angles\r\nwhen using homing torps, try to predict enemy movement and only lock onto the enemy if the torps look like they\u2019re going to miss;

I will rank my recommendations for each of the Armoury resources. These recommendations are mostly based on these ships\u2019 maximum performance in random battles, but I also take into account ease of use, credit earning potential and ship price (namely Neustrashimy and Black are more expensive due to formerly being steel ships). I do not take \u201cfun\u201d into consideration because that is a subjective feeling and varies from person to person, hence no point in considering it as a variable.\r\n\r\nCoal\r\nKearsarge > Salem > Malta > Tulsa, Marceau, Groningen > Immelmann, Moskva, Brisbane, Azuma, \u00c4gir, Black, Neustrashimy, Sherman, Tromp, Alvaro de Bazan, U-4501 > Gro\u00dfer Kurf\u00fcrst, Yoshino, Napoli, Khabarovsk, Marco Polo, Carnot > Iwami, Pommern > Hayate, Halford \r\n\r\nI do not recommend Z-44 at all simply because of how weak she is. I also do not recommend any ship below tier 9 as coal is a very highly demanded resource with a very limited gain rate.\r\n\r\nSteel\r\nThe recommendation priority here is less pronounced than with coal ships as there are quite a few very strong or otherwise \u201cinteresting\u201d steel ships, so I have split them into priority categories. Pick your steel ships based on your class and play style preference.\r\n\r\nBourgogne, Incomparable, Ruggiero di Lauria, Ragnar > Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mecklenburg, Stalingrad, Austin, Z-42, Gato > Shikishima, Plymouth, Vallejo\r\n\r\nThe reason why I put Vallejo so low, despite her having tier 9 premium credit gain, is because her gameplay style isn\u2019t particularly unique, she can\u2019t be characterised as \u201cvery strong\u201d and there are credit grinding ships that are far more easily accessible. \r\n\r\nRP\r\nOhio > Illinois, Druid, Vampire > Sicilia, Colbert, Siegfried, Hector, Van Speijk, Paolo Emilio > Slava, Sevastopol > Gibraltar\r\n\r\nDo note that Slava, Sevastopol and Gibraltar are rather poor performers and you might be better off investing your RP into unique/legendary upgrades.\r\n\r\nDoubloons\r\nThis is a huge category so I will divide this by tier.\r\nTier 9\r\nKearsarge > Tulsa, Groningen > Sun
